"Great Sunday afternoon flick for all the family. Is it going to change your life? No but my husband and I enjoyed it, fun fresh concept with a few laughs, heart and a climatic ending! ",3.5
"Awesome.
Great movie, great actors, great story, great visual effects. 
I don‚Äôt understand this poor score at all. 
Critics are just totally dumb. And when you read their reviews, you realise that yah, they‚Äôre totally dumb.",5
"A throw back to real movies, emotions, and journeying into the unknown. 90s references were awesome and the friendship between characters was reminiscent of classic movies we grew up with. In a world where electronics are already a problematic escape, this movie also has cultural and societal commentary that we need to look at and begin talking about before we find ourselves lost in this state. Excellent story! ",5
peopper sollid movie.,3.5
"Una pel√≠cula m√°s de Netflix o lo que se puede esperar de ellos. Lenta, aburrida por muchos momentos decepcionante por parte de los directores. Chris Pratt interpretando a Chris Pratt y Millie Bobby sin chiste. Lo √∫nico atractivo de esta pel√≠cula son los robots estilo animatronicos de ‚Äúfive night at freddy‚Äú, el cast que decepciona y √©l lo nombres detr√°s de esta pel√≠cula. Un idea buena pero mal ejecutada. ",2
I'm not sure why the critics disliked this movie so much. I found it to be an interesting and enjoyable sci-fi film with a great cast and excellent special FX. The concept about AI and robots/machines is interesting and well handled. The 2 lead actors are likeable and acts really well. An overall solid film.,3.5
This movie is absolutly the best one i ever seen. This film got me emotional when Michelle unplug the machiean that is connected to the brother. This film deserves more than 15%. P.S WHY!?,5
"A little cheesy derivitive and I'm not entirely convinced it was worth the price tag but, it is still a very entertaining watch and not at ALL deserving of the critics hate. ",4
Absolutely loved it ü•∞ ,5
"Movie had a generic feel to it, may have been the CGI but the cohesiveness of the plot was below subpar.",1.5
Great movie. Great actors and so funny. Whole family enjoyed it. ,5
"This had glimmers of what the creative premise could've been in its first act, but the moment that a robot started singing The Clash's cover of I Fought The Law while Chris Pratt nods along with his stupid haircut, I knew this was the generic Netflix movie crap I was fearing it would be.",2
"I enjoyed it a lot. It is an easy to understand movie, It touches the topic of how technology is being used today. While the movie has a sci fi.half funny half serious, human-robot drama going on, in one moment during the movie we think about about a word that we can work while resting and have an opinion about it. Very well done.",4.5
Chris Pratt is amazing as always!,5
"The Electric State:heard a lot about it-the cast,the issues and even the costs which didn't bother me 1 iota..A lot of downers expressing  a bland cast which I found ratthering charming and cast nicely for the movie.$320 +million to make a movie isn't  chump change but considering the movie has a good cast great special effects and a heart warming story-to many people want dread and glamorized doom,this is more them just a story about the woes of an alter-universe-it is about survival.I would rather kick back and get lost in a movie with an attempt at heart then watch a movie that crams every piece of storyline down your throat.Kudos as this one is a keeper when other films fail.",3.5
"This movie gets a lot a hate but was what I expected which was a casual movie with some action, comedy and a plot line that follows the general Hollywood formula. If you don't expect this to be the best movie of the year you should enjoy it. ",4
"Whoever called this movie 'a piece of junk' should be declared 'mentally unsound'. A lot of movies in history were declared flop or slow starters, but went on to become cult classics in their own genre. This is going to be one of them.",5
I 100% don‚Äôt agree with the critics. Was it gone With the Wind? No. Was it an entertaining ride? Absolutely. I would love for them to make a sequel.,5
"Not many movies can evoke an emotional response. This is genuinely a great movie. I can imagine reading the book first would greatly affect your opinion in the sense that I‚Äôm not sure anyone can name a single movie that has lived up to expectations based on a book. That being said put the book out of your mind completely if you have read it. Drop all expectations and just trust the process. While small things can be criticized, keep an open mind. This movie is not just another apocalyptic tech takes over story. While the entirety of the story is greatly exaggerated, it is a great analogy of the world we live in today. Consumed by what we think has saved us. Instead of listening we react. Take the time to really reflect on the message and feel what the characters feel. Though I doubt anyone will read this or it‚Äôll change anything. It‚Äôs definitely still a good watch. ",5
This is an awesome looking film which is quite thin in substance. This film does improve as it goes on and my daughter loved it. ,3
"Inegavelmente lindo e impressionante, visualmente √© muito lindo, chamativo, e com muita criatividade. Principalmente em efeitos, que s√£o pra mim o verdadeiro ponto alto do filme.

Mas, j√° n√£o podemos dizer muitas coisas sobre ROTEIRO e DIRE√á√ÉO dos Irm√£os Russos, que para mim, fizeram mais uma obra extremamente esquec√≠vel.. e que poderia ter sido MUITO mais. Pois promissor com certeza √©.

Personagens beem fracos e desinteressantes, trilha sonora sem originalidade, apenas b√°sico do b√°sico. Efeitos sonoros s√£o um grande acerto pelo menos.
E o elenco, √© muito chamativo de fato.. pena que alguns deles s√£o um desperd√≠cio gigante. E tamb√©m alguns s√£o personagens que j√° encarnaram antes no passado.

No geral, bem fraco e esquec√≠vel. Mais um filme dos irm√£os Russos que poderia ter sido muito melhor. 

""√â ruim?"" - Com certeza N√ÉO.
 ""√â bom?"" -  Para mim, SIM.
""Eu gostei?"" -  SIM, gostei bastante.

""Vale a pena?""

Na minha opini√£o, vale sim a pena. Maass √© bem esquec√≠vel.
Apesar de eu ter gostado.

"This movie lacks any substance. The Idea that robots are treated effectively as evil slaves is done better in so many other sci-fi movies. The acting is nat bad, but is lost in in the mediocre plot.",1
"It is a good movie. It is not bad. I am not trying to sound simple but frankly the critics got it wrong. Bad movies have things in common and this movie does not belong with bad movies. I like it. It was ENTERTAINING. This is important. No one has time to sit through movies that are not entertaining. That being said, my only complaint is that it is the same story that has been told 10000 times. Good vs Evil. Evil dude does bas things and good people try to take down the evil guy. Avatar? Same movie. (For example)",4.5
"First ever review of my Life but couldt disagree more with all the audience.
I can't really believe people saying it's a good movie. I can't also believe someone decided to produce this kind of over-budgeted thing.
VFX were good.
Be kind to yourself, if you have two hours to waste, watch something else.",0.5
"Once again ignore critics, unless it's a movie about a prostitute or has subtitles or is a movie about how someone beats the odds this the critics will immediately relegate this to a terrible movie.  

The Electric State is a pretty fun watch.  Is it a great movie?  Probably not, is it good enough to be entertaining?  Absolutely.  The movie takes place after a war between Robots and Humans after robots achieved sentience and wanted freedom from servitude.   The movie is about that and it's about a brother and sister reuniting and finding others to help against a common foe.  Again, ignore the critics judge it for yourself.",3.5
"Great Movie! Well thought out.  Could be a single movie or is open to a sequel based on one of the last clips.  Great family fun.  I think everyone who takes too technical of an approach and doesn‚Äôt appreciate this film,  doesn‚Äôt remember the wonderment of young families having a relaxing time watching a movie. It‚Äôs not meant to be epic, or life altering, symbolic of deeper things. Although it does deal in foreseeable moral issues in the future. Or the loss of a family member in death. But It‚Äôs just a normal family movie!! If this was made in 1990 it would have been the most epic movie.  People who are not appreciating this movie are getting use to amazing movies and not appreciating them. Now they are constantly board and critical. Hey Netflix great Job!! ",5
"Em 1990, explodiu a guerra entre os seres humanos e os rob√¥s. Em 1994, a guerra terminou com a vit√≥ria dos humanos, que usaram uma tecnologia desenvolvida por um cientista chamado Ethan Skate, que transfere a mente das pessoas para corpos eletr√¥nicos chamados de drones. Os rob√¥s foram exilados em uma Zona de Exce√ß√£o. E a empresa de Skate enriqueceu com sua tecnologia. √â quando Michelle descobre que a mente do seu irm√£o falecido est√° no corpo de um rob√¥ e ela decide ir at√© a Zona de Exce√ß√£o para descobrir a verdade, por√©m h√° uma conspira√ß√£o bem maior por tr√°s. Os anos 90 viraram os novos anos 80? √â meio estranho uma fic√ß√£o cient√≠fica com tantos conceitos inexistentes hoje em dia, passar durante a d√©cada de 90. Por que n√£o jogar para o futuro? S√≥ para aproveitar a trilha sonora? Depois dos Vingadores, os irm√£os Russo n√£o acertaram mais. E este filme segue os outros: uma bola na trave. Tinha os elementos certos, o elenco certo, mas algo n√£o me pegou. Chris Pratt faz mais uma c√≥pia do Starlord. Tucci e Esposito entregam os vil√µes que eles est√£o acostumados a fazer, com um p√© nas costas. Millie Bobby Brown n√£o acertou como protagonista como em Stranger Things. Talvez porque l√° existe uma qu√≠mica entre o elenco que lhe d√° o suporte necess√°rio. Aqui ela e Pratt n√£o combinaram. Ficou for√ßado o motivo pelo qual ele vai ajud√°-la, Na parte t√©cnica, o filme se sai bem (tamb√©m com um or√ßamento de US$ 320 milh√µes). Os efeitos visuais s√£o muito bons e mesclam bem o CGI com animatronics e outras t√©cnicas. The Electric State √© o filme que ficou no quase, sem um bom roteiro, que aproveitasse tudo o que a hist√≥ria proporcionaria.",3
"It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it feels extremely generic. The characters aren't very good and it misses the point of the source material. ",3
"Is it a perfect movie that's going to win award after award? No. Is it a horrible movie that is unwatchable? Also no. It's fine. You can put it on watch it, follow it and just enjoy it with some popcorn. Seriously that's all it's trying to be. I don't understand all the hate reviews for it. It's like certain movies fall into this thing where it becomes popular to hate or love it and then the masses just go with that in order to fit in. This movie is 100% more entertaining than Wicked and yet they have the exact opposite reviews. (Wicked is an unbearable movie, with bad acting and CGI that drags) The Electric State has decent acting, pretty good CGI and a fine pace. Storyline and plot isn't complicated. The only thing is it feels like Ready Player One meets the MCU. If you go in wanting to hate any movie, odds are you will. If you go into this movie just wanting something fun to watch for a couple hours, it'll do that. ",4
"Definitely better than the reviews. The world is interesting while it doesn't make sense when you think about it. The characters ,humans and bots alike are kinda cool and work well together. The emotional background stories are simple but work. Action is meh but has some very fun ideas. All in all I am positively surprised. ",4
"I often find that if the critics hate it, the audience it's designed for will love it. This is perfect escapism, what a fun and well done movie. This was such a fun watch. It was a great way to redo end rethink the 90s and all the touches and characters were so great. Thank you Netflix! Millie was great in this. Same with Chris. A+",5
"It's a fun movie. As others have stated, it could have been much better using most of the same story, directing and effects, but it's definitely worth a couple hours on a Saturday night. I really didn't like the ending though...one of the parts, among others, which could have been more thought out and could have made this movie great.",3.5
"Absolutely loved this movie reminds me of some Jim Henson productions. Nice story original characters and setting. The idea was pretty original which is lacking nowadays, good acting, a good sci-fi, adventure with some heartfelt themes. Bad guy could've been developed a bit more in my opinion, but definitely worth a watch. ",5
1000 plot holes in the first 10 minutes. 0/10. Waste of time. Not even entertaining. So bad I made a rotten tomatoes profile just to give it this review. ,1
"Fun Gen X nostalgia with some great punchlines. I imagined a packed theater on a Saturday night laughing out loud at the screen. The FX was better than most of the recent blockbuster movies released in the past few years, rarely was I taken out of the moment by a bad effects shot. Tighter editing would have made this a better experience. Millie and Chris are a great together. Maybe in the MCU in the future?",3.5
Top 5 worst movie I‚Äôve ever seen,0.5
This is one of my favourite movies of the last few years! I have NO IDEA why the critics are cutting it down. The critics have no credibility anymore.,5
"I always like it when a good movie is panned by the major critics.  In fact, a critically-panned movie almost always ends up being delightful - as The Electric State was.  I honestly cannot understand the negative reviews.

Do yourself a favor.  Only listen to the critics as a way of finding great movies, because great movies are the ones the critics consistently pan.

The Russo Brothers have created yet another brilliant movie.",5
"Don‚Äôt listen to the critics! This movie is tons of fun, period. Anyone who says this is a bad movie doesn‚Äôt know how to enjoy things. It‚Äôs sad. ",5
"The critics must have watched a different movie. This movie was good, really good, really entertaining. My wife and I and teenage son and daughter all enjoyed it for family movie night.  Let yourself go with the story. It's an emotional build right up to a very satisfying end.  The story of the robots suck you in and you build that connection.  Unique characters, visual scenes, great cast, engaging story. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  ",4
"I absolutely loved it, it takes you on a ride of emotions, the hate for this movie is honestly so forced.",5
"So different. Dark and funny, great sets and scenes. Sometimes I could totally see the comic book behind the scene. How do they think of this stuff!!",5
"Its missing the spark that makes films memorable, exciting, and unforgettable. 

Watch it, but dont expect the explosions on screen to make your heart skip a beat.  ",2.5
I really enjoyed this movie. It has a unique plot and is very well done. Not sure why the critics don't  like it. I think young and old will enjoy this movie. ,5
"My husband and I loved this movie. It‚Äôs heart warming, funny and lots of action.  ",5
Entertaining movie great cast ,5
"Yes its not a deep thinking movie with a complex and thought provoking plot, but while we do need movies like that, sometimes we just need fun movies where we can sit back, relax, and enjoy the movie! This movie is one of those types and if the critics don't like it, who cares, most everyone else seems to.",5
"Loved it! Great acting, I laughed a lot throughout and it had emotional yet satisfying ending. ",5
"Critics are off their rocker, Rotten Tomatoes needs to change who reviews these movies... It's creepy, interesting, well-acted enough, and visually thrilling enough to be regarded much better. Even the storyline was better than I expected. As a sci fi lover the visual aesthetics and setting alone were enough for me to give it 4 stars. The car being thrown at the window scene was one notable moment of incredible filmmaking to me. ",4
There was a good movie in there somewhere. Basically a Wizard of Oz story with pacing issues and boring dialogue. The robots were the best part. Really dragged on with not enough going on until the big battle at the end.  Would have been better with a better director like Spielberg or George Miller.  Millie Bobby Brown is bland. She's no Carrie Fisher. Chris Pratt is played out. They needed to amp up the emotional range. ,2.5
Solid practical and digital effects hold up this predictable but average movie. Despite the basic story it is an enjoyable watch. The movies performers are good but nothing outstanding. It's a solid popcorn flick. Something you can through on and simply enjoy. The 90's nostalgia alone makes it a tone of fun. ,3.5
It was actually quite entertaining. Not sure if it‚Äôs because my expectations were low or what. I think 15% from the critics isn‚Äôt justified. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more like 50-60%,4
"What it lacks in depth and a substantive backstory, it makes up for in charm, character, and warmth... in spite of its somewhat dreary dystopian story. It plays as a YA Sci-Fi, and delivers on this",3.5
"Fun, Entertaining and lovely Art Direction. The Movie serves its purpose. Millie Bobby Brown  and Chris Pratt are engaging.
In terms of Plot - the inciting incident/call to adventure (from the contextual dream/to the sudden appearance of the Robot/ and how quickly Millie decides to follow it without questioning it too much) it seems a bit compressed - but overall: an Entertaining Movie and a good time following the ride. ",4
"Uninteresting premise, worse execution.",1.5
Can‚Äôt understand the critics‚Äô absolute hatred of this movie. It made me feel a range of emotions and had a poignant message about our need for human connection. Amazing cast.,4
"Seems like the star of the movie was special effects.
Story and characters could have been made more 3 dimensional.  I felt very meh after watching this. My expectations were high, too high. I wish I hadn't watched this.  And I'm huge fans of the main cast,  movie just a bad story or very badly directed. I'm sure it could have been better, with better writing and directing.
Was so hoping this would be good.",1
"AMAZING!!! Chris Pratt and Millie Bobby Brown together, are you kidding me?! Great story, acting, CGI and cast! Save yourself some and only read this review and go watch it! ",4.5
A brilliant story of the hatred of men towards those they see inferior all through an adolescent lense.,5
Our family really enjoyed it. Some curse words but besides that it was a simple yet fun enough storyline for everyone to enjoy. Graphics were amazing!,4.5
"Ing.
Personally, I really enjoy the retro-futuristic setting, as it is visually appealing and original. However, I believe the plot, resolution, and central conflict lack depth, which weakens the development of the story. Despite this, the actors delivered outstanding performances, but the overall result fails to stand out, earning a rating of 3/5. Undoubtedly, this work had the potential to offer something far more memorable.
Esp.
""Personalmente, me encanta la ambientaci√≥n retrofuturista, ya que es visualmente atractiva y original. Sin embargo, considero que la trama, el desenlace y el conflicto central carecen de profundidad, lo que debilita el desarrollo de la historia. A pesar de esto, los actores hicieron un trabajo destacado en sus interpretaciones, pero el resultado general no logra destacarse, mereciendo una calificaci√≥n de 3/5. Sin duda, es una obra que ten√≠a el potencial de ofrecer algo mucho m√°s memorable.""",3
"I'm not sure why this show has been getting so much hate it's cute, it's sometimes fun, it's insightful and occasionally very dark. And above all it's worth a watch",5
"Great storyline, acting and overall emotion. Acting/genre similar to Guardians of the Galaxy. Would definitely recommend to others.",5

I loved it. I was drawn in from beginning to end and thought it was masterfully imagined.,5
You could tell the script almost from the beginning. It feels like and empty film and it's sad because It could have been a lot better,2

"This should have been in theaters. I took a half star because it was a bit slow at times, but overall my whole family loved it.",4.5
"Enjoyable with my 9 year old. Probably could have been better as a series, lots of potential for a bigger story and more character development. Feel the movie format didn't serve this concepts potential. ",3
Why some people hate this film so much?!?? it‚Äôs good!!!!,5
"I could see the potential this movie had to be something fun and cute to watch with the family, but it really just lacked in the actual story telling aspect to give the full emotional impact they were going for at a lot of times. Like most movies now, it felt like a lot of the attention was just put on the action and graphics of the movie, and not on the actual story. Entertaining watch, but definitely don‚Äôt care to watch it again.",3
"I don‚Äôt know why all the critics are hating on this film so much. I loved the 90s vibe, relaxed humour and in today‚Äôs world of technology, social media and constant distraction, that finding genuine connection with those closest to us, is what matters. Really enjoyed it. The critics need to loosen up a bit, and enjoy it for what it is.",4
"My 9 year old gives it 4 out of 5 :) me probably 1 out of 5 , the 2 being for Millie Bobby brown and Mr Peanut",4
"This was exactly what I expected based topic synonopsis, and my own viewing experiences. It's good enough to be a fun story with more chapters i. The future and serves as a passable showcase for some of the topline talent. Of note, I'm always li d of surprised at the professional viewers reviews. Calm down, these Netflix movies may not all be franchise starters, but they keep us mildly entertained/distracted just fine. Streaming services do not have to specifically condone or challeng any lifestyle or humanistic view. So it's OK if these 
Movies don't end up in the criterion collection. These are popcorn, rose wine, and girls put cookie flicks!",4
Worst movie ever razzie worthy,1
Really nice and cool visuals about a dystopian future. Very entertaining and that is what movies is about,3.5
"I literally got through about 10 minutes and that was only because of the actors. 

Terrible script and Netflix was banking on a bad decision.

There have been so many other quality projects that Netflix could have sunk their teeth into. Instead, they are backing whatever horse that they have with MBB. I'm not sure what their contract is that she's in everyone one of their films, but this was not the way to see it through to fulfillment. 

Netflix truly needs to get back to their roots with other creative means. This was not the way to go. ",0.5
Ok hard one here as i like the actors in this i even liked the bots just did not like script lazy and dull,2.5
"The critics are being way too harsh. This is a good, dumb, fun movie that you can watch with your brain shut off for a couple of hours. Sure there are ‚Äúmessages‚Äù and ‚Äúsymbolism‚Äù and blah blah blah, but this is watchable without all that nonsense analysis.",4.5
Most of the dicks writing neg reviews have forgotten what it's like to be a teenager and just to enjoy the nonsense.,5
"When you ignore the fact that it's based on a book, it's a really good movie
I was having fun watching it",4.5
"I don‚Äôt know why anyone would think it‚Äôs a bad movie. Nothing wrong with a little cheese in the dialogue. The visuals were great, the story has a strong base, the casting was good. It was objectively good movie. ",5
"This is another movie where it confirmed to me that the audience score is by far more important to me than the critic score.

Because I watch movies to be entertained. And, while some things can really take me out of the movie, nothing in this movie did.

So it was fun. Robots, characters that I liked enough to want them to succeed, a pleasant arc to the movie, and so on.

I don't know how well it represents the source material, if the topic could ever be done well enough to please a critic, etc., but it was fun. Worth the time.",4
"It is upsetting to learn how much money Netflix put into the film ""The Electric State."" This movie has star power for sure, but it is not enough to save it. The sci-fi premise is not interesting or anything new and the story is just boring. Even when the action scenes were going down, I felt like I was just waiting for it to end. This movie doesn't do justice to the actors involved and it is genuinely frustrating to see talent wasted like this. Overall, it is a boring and forgettable movie with plenty of better alternatives available out there in the robot sci-fi genre, I can't see why anyone would want to sit through this one.",1.5
"The source material leans ""R"", so when the studios decided PG-13 for the movie, then tried so obviously to make it family friendly, it killed the franchise. Hollywood needs to learn that successful films remove all the extra cooks from the kitchen and just let chef do their thing.

How many dimwitted executives must have added their bad input to turn what could have been a show with a large adult following into a lame generic show for nobody in particular.",0.5
"While the 90's retro angle was interesting at first, within 10 minutes it was obvious that this wasn't going to be relevant to the story.  Millie Bobby Brown, a very likable, appealing actress, must have been cast when she was significantly younger since her actual age was distracting, particularly when repeatedly she is referred to as ""kid"".  The bad guy, Ethan Skate,  has a name like a real life genius billionaire who Hollywood loved and now demonizes, all due to politics.  But Tucci is always good.  The b & w video screens as drone faces was very interesting to me.  A creepy effect that worked.  The storyline was too derivative to be unpredictable and entertaining.  Chris Pratt's character gets a haircut in ACT III, but that's the only change he undergoes.  His attitude reversal about helping the ""kid"" was blamed on the haircut, which was the best line in the movie--but it sounds like something Pratt improvised... Like so many movies, the set-up is interesting, but once set-up it's predictable.  Why go to so much trouble and expense for such a tired plot line?  The wildly different, comical robots kept me watching.    ",2.5
"It‚Äôs never been so painfully obvious that the directors didn‚Äôt even bother glancing at the source material. What should have been a haunting, Robosynthetic Electric Sheep version of The Road ended up as a Frankenstein mess that feels like a bizarre cocktail of The Avengers and Borderlands, but without any of the charm or coherence. Either the Directors are just that out of touch or didn't care and wanted to make their own thing. Both equally damning. ",0.5
"Sometimes I just want to be entertained and escape from the daily grind and this movie did that for me. I initially watched it with no expectations at all since I had already read a couple bad reviews from critics but, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it. It was funny and interesting and I enjoyed the sci fi aspect of the story. ",4.5
"Imagine if someone took a haunting, heartfelt graphic novel about loss, loneliness, and late-stage tech dystopia‚Äîand ran it through a Netflix-branded smoothie machine until all that was left was glossy, flavorless goop. That‚Äôs The Electric State. What was once a poignant, post-apocalyptic meditation has been sanitized into a 2-hour Super Bowl commercial of special effects and nostalgic ""vibes"". It's all style, zero soul. Corporate sci-fi cosplay at its blandest. If you ever wanted to watch a robot apocalypse brought to you by algorithm-approved melancholy and zero actual commentary‚Äîcongrats, they made it just for you!",0.5
"While this movie probably won't win any awards, i thoroughly enjoyed it. Its a good sunday afternoon movie. Kids and adults can enjoy, just don't put to much thought into it and go with the flow. The ending was a bit cheesey but other than that, the effects are great and  its worth a couple hours of ur time. Take no notice of the critics, make ur own mind up and give it a go.",4
"Gonna win an oscar?...Nope, but so what. For a 'popcorn' corn movie that the whole family could sit though and enjoy together it hit the mark (and sometimes, that's enough).  ",4
Gawd awful. Chris Pratt playing his standard Chris Pratt character. We lasted about 20 minutes. Netflix paid how much for this?,1
"I thought the trailer looked good, but critic reviews were awful, and the rest of the family didn't want to watch it because of them. I finally managed to get the family to agree to give it a go today, and the consensus is we're so glad I kept pushing! Definitely a combination of elements of Guardians, Enola Holmes, Sweet Tooth, and of course good music! The 2 hours went by so fast. Thoroughly enjoyable and one I'll definitely watch again!",5
"I like this film, it does cover a wide range of viewing audiences, but that is part of its charm. Cinematically beautiful, and cheesy enough to be fun. Most will like it's playful characters who don't take themselves too seriously. Room for improvement yes, totally rubbish NO!",4
"The New York Times got it SO wrong again! Claiming it was horrible. What a surprise! This was a fun movie...a little bit of Guardians of the Galaxy, Enola Holmes, and Raiders of the Lost Ark! Give us more like this Netflix!",5
The film was so predictable that in the first 10 minutes I had figured out the entire plot and lost interest and switched off with 30 minutes left of the film,1.5
"Russo's can't make anything outside of extremely calculated world of Marvel and Netfix seemed to have a one sided feud against Movies theirselves.

This Movie was God awful and is another reminder that Hollywood and Massive Film Companies can only produce Slop.,0.5
"I like sci-fi, robot and weird story, but this is not for me. I dont know why but everything feel unatractive. Nigthmare fuel all, I can really think about it.",1.5
"I loved this movie. It was a great escape with three generations in the living room with popcorn. It‚Äôs probably not going to win Academy awards, except for maybe production design, but it was fun and emotional at times. Well worth the watch if you just want to forget your life for a couple of hours.",4
after watching the trailer a few weeks ago i was slightly disappointed with the end product' it wasn't what i expected and was slow to watch. The CGI was amazing but the story lacked soul and the ending was a bit silly. Overall' an entertaining but forgettable movie.  ,2
"I have watched hundreds and hundreds of shows and movies, and I always come to check out reviews on here beforehand. If you name it, I've probably seen it. 

This movie is the first time out of anything and everything I've watched, that I've felt the critics got it wrong. Is it the best movie ever made? No. Did I create an account and post my first review because I enjoyed it? Yes.

Not every movie has to be high art, The Electric State is good, pure, fun. Good on the Russo brothers, Milly Bobby Brown, Chris Pratt and everyone else.",4
"An enjoyable romp with talented actors, that I felt suffered more from the cutting room floor than any lack of storytelling finesse. We get the gist of the plot, but somehow fail to connect with the emotion of the story. Obvious plot-holes also make this movie less enjoyable, as we ask why and how our characters got to such an alternate reality. This movie just felt rushed. ",5
"This Movie is an Instant Classic.  Thanks for making this awesome movie.  I will watch many times in my life, which is more then I can can say for a lot of movies!    I want more movies like this.  Again....  Instant Classic!!!",5
"This movie isn't going to win any academy awards, but it is interesting and entertaining. I think it is worth seeing.",3
"For some reason, two actors who do know how to act suddenly don‚Äôt know how to act. I don‚Äôt know if it was the monotone script or poor direction, but this was shockingly bad. Kind of a bummer because I expected a lot more than whatever was going on here.",1
"Idk how the audience score is so high, probably because you're all obsessed with Millie Bobby Brown but the movie is so bad lmao ",0.5

"AMAZING MUSIC CHOICES!!!! and the combo of millie bobbie brown and chris pratt was awesome!!!!! this movie made me cry, laugh, sing, dance, yell, feel almost every emotion! it‚Äôs DEFINITELY 100% worth the watch!!!",5
"It‚Äôs not that bad as some are making out to be. Was it too big of a budget? Yes‚Ä¶ was it horrible to watch? No‚Ä¶ it was still entertaining. Based (very loosely) on the graphic novel, the look was there, the imagery  and designs of the bots, but the script? Okay, a bit of a typical Hollywood reimagining of the overall story. But that‚Äôs usually the case for many ‚Äúbased on‚Äù stories. The movie was fine. Stop bitching about it. Like I said, too much money for production, not enough in script development. I‚Äôll say this though‚Ä¶ it was way‚ÄîWAY‚Äîbetter than Zach Snyder‚Äôs awful Rebel Moon films. Now that was a waste of money, if we truly want to talk about budgets that should never have happened.

We need to remove critics from the reviews. They‚Äôve been trash their entire existence. Audience has it right per usual solid movie fun to watch ,5
"Based on the critics‚Äô reviews we almost didn‚Äôt watch this. We were glad we did! This is actually a great movie. Different, poignant, fun, sad at times, action filled, and with a lot of subtle references poking fun at the world we live in today. All the negative reviews seem to either miss these, treat this as an adult movie - it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs a teen movie - or be so up themselves about the ‚Äúsource material‚Äù that they can‚Äôt let go and enjoy what‚Äôs in front of them. Which, ironically, is the message of the whole movie. And the story on which it‚Äôs based. Let it go, watch the movie with your kids, enjoy and have fun! I promise you won‚Äôt regret it. Seriously, I promise you won‚Äôt regret it. ",4
"I don't understand the hate on this. 15%? Yall need to enjoy stuff more. Anyway, Chris Pratt is amazing as always, Millie Bobbie Brown is fantastic, I love the references to Eleven she gets, I love her role with her brother and her dynamic with him as a bot and Chris Pratt's character. (Honestly forgettable name unforgettable character.) I think it's solid, great movie, doesn't deserve the hate.",4
I thought it was a good movie.  I didn't love the ending but otherwise I liked the special effects and the world creation.  The characters were good.  The robot characters were cute and entertaining.  ,4
"I absolutely loves this movie, the hate is forced. It was emotional, funny, and there was more than enough action. I can just recommend ro watch it, one of my favourite movies.",5
It‚Äôs a fun movie to watch. The robots were neat. Plot needed some work but the visual effects made up for it ,4
More corporate slop. ,0.5
It‚Äôs ah great movie!! I liked it make me cry .. i‚Äôm waiting for the two part!!  ,5
"Worth watching if you're in the mood for dumb, obvious, predictable, unoriginal but somehow kind of fun.  If you don't expect much from the start, it's just good enough to be worth the time.  The pacing was good, the special effects were great, and though it didn't excel at anything, it didn't fail badly enough at anything to spoil the romp.  None of the performances were particularly noteworthy, but they all did enough to make the film work.  ",3.5
I enjoyed the movie it was good if your into robot movies ,5
"‚ÄúThe Electric State‚Äù may look pretty with its occasional visual flair, but it‚Äôs a lifeless, uninspired slog with surprisingly flat performances. A charming concept is wasted on a story that feels as dull as it is directionless. Such a shame ‚Äì there was real potential here.",1.5

This movie was incredibly dumb. But good enough for children. ,3
"I'd read the previews a week or so back and felt a little saddened. But just now, myself and my 14 year old son just watched this. It was more than watchable. Nothing groundbreaking...but the acting and effects were good. Soundtrack was pretty neat with some 90s records..some of which played in alternate styles.
You do worse than watch this with the kids on a Saturday night.

"Quite a good premise but also predictable, overall a lot better than the critics give it credit for.",3.5
Don't listen to critics ,5
It‚Äôs apparent that the ‚Äúcritics‚Äù were not watching the same movie as I did. After seeing their low opinion of the movie I figured I would be disappointed. And I was‚Ä¶.disappointed that it was surprisingly good entertainment. I think the critics should find a better line of work. ,4.5
Its a fun adventure movie. Really don't understand the low scores,4.5

"It's not even a terrible movie, oh my days. ",3.5
"The ""plot twist"" is exposed early on but the end result was not what I expected. Overall this is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination, it's not great but I'd be happy to watch it again. Acting is good, pacing is perfect, plot felt like an amalgamation of a few things I'd seen before but unique enough that I couldn't name them.

Don't be put off by what feels like a concerted effort to disparage this film.",3.5
"Im a kid so I‚Äôm probably not the most reliable source though I do know something about writing techniques and stuff.
Let‚Äôs start with the good. As someone who has read the source material I must say it is impressive how well they have recreated Simon Stalenhags art. Some shots look straight out of the original novel. From a visual perspective it is a master piece the CGI used is incredible and the original Electric state was pretty visually great. Also (SPOILERS) at the end of the movie this little robot dies but then there is this plot twist that there was a littler robot inside which I think is great. And it doesn‚Äôt come out of nowhere too since we‚Äôve seen that robot inside bigger robots. However story wise it lacks. 
It is full of exposition dumps, the opening just stops the story to tell us the lore. It also doesn‚Äôt do a very good job at getting you attached to the characters. I can‚Äôt even remember a single characters name besides The Butcher. They just don‚Äôt do enough to show us who they are. Sure they tell us things but they never give us a reason to care. Also they just had to hire the most overrated actor in the world huh? Chris Pratt. Seriously he has an incredibly narrow range and his line delivery is so flat.",2
"I saw the reviews and thought this was going to be a terrible film. It‚Äôs not - it‚Äôs a children‚Äôs film which I enjoyed with mine and it was an entertaining film which gave me a few chuckles and a gentle tug on the emotional strings.

Is it a masterpiece, no but it was fun romp that despite its poor reviews is far better and more enjoyable than many other ‚Äòcritically‚Äô acclaimed films I have watched. ",4
Not as bad as many have made it out to be.  ,3.5
"The film adaptation of 'The Electric State' diverges significantly from Simon St√•lenhag's original vision. Key elements, like the unique post-apocalyptic aesthetic and nuanced portrayal of technology, seem diluted. The narrative feels simplified, likely underestimating the audience‚Äôs capacity for complexity. Unfortunately, Millie Bobby Brown's performance falls flat, lacking the emotional depth needed to anchor the story. The film seems to rely on her popularity rather than engaging with the rich material of the source. For fans of the graphic novel, this adaptation might not capture the essence that made the book so distinctive.",1.5
"This is an interesting and light and funny film.
I enjoyed watching it very much, it caught my attention and captivated it from the first moment to the last.
The film is not perfect and even has small problems, but as a film it holds well all the ideas it wants to convey and does convey.
It may not be a masterpiece or a film from fairy tales, but it is an entertaining and interesting film.",4.5

"Great action-adventure movie. Just relax and have fun! 
Movie critics have rotten brains, so don't care about their opinion. They only love smart drama movies with something because they are ""smart"" from it. For ""smart"" I like to READ neural science and quantum physics BOOKS. Movies are for fun, and this one is fun ;)",5
"Heartwarming and thoughtprovoking. The script was not the best.I've seen these actors , but it's definitely worth your time. ",3.5
"Watched it on a cold, rainy evening when had nothing else better to do.  I went in with no preconceived notions on if it would be bad, or good.  I honestly thought it was kind of cute.  It was just too long.  They could have made it a 1.5 hour movie and it would have been better for it, honestly.  It's cheesy, and it's not awesome, but if you have a rainy day and nothing else to do, it's not that bad.  I've seen far worse rated better, if that makes sense.  ",3
It was a cute movie that was PG. We fell in love with the robots and other characters. ,4
"Trate de que me guste, pero no pude pasar de los 20 minutos .",1
"THE ELECTRIC STATE seems designed to please, almost algorithmically so, with various elements cobbled together like one of its many fanciful automatons. The alternative, retro-futuristic world allows the unique aesthetic of the source book to come to life in some impressive ways, but the selective tech advancement also strains credulity, sometimes painfully so. The plot is standard issue, and skates by on the charms of a winsome cast, who simply can't elevate the rote sentimentalism of the story. It's passable popcorn flick entertainment for sure, but like so many of the directors' comic book movies, assumes an audience that is dumb and easily stupefied by spectacle.",2.5
"Great movie, I was concerned because of the rotten score, even pushed watching it. I‚Äôm glad I did though. Lots of fun and ended well. ",5
Its a decent fun family film. Worth a watch. Not sure why the critics seem to hate it so much.,4
Try reading the book. The Russo brothers sure didn‚Äôt.,1
"Very very stupid movie, for stupid people ",1
"Egads there a couple hours of life wasted, potential squandered i understand actors have to work but dang have some standards....",1
this movie made me cry. and not in a good way.,0.5
"Why all the hate?

I never read the book but I found this movie to be a fun modern movie the whole family can enjoy. Millie portrays the quintessential big sister. Chris is awesome as always with his lovable comedic hero character. The robots and special effects are top notch. The story is good for the most part. I would highly recommend this movie.",5
"What a terrible, uninspired bore of a movie. A stab in the heart of the creative roots it came from. The source material is 10 out of 10, but this is nothing like it and it shows in every second, that feels like a minute. I had to break up my watching of this over 3-4 sessions because it's THAT bad. Every single actor in this should be ashamed and The Russo Brothers should be forever barred from AAA Studios.",0.5
"I thought I was a great movie and the animation was very well done.  Something different and decent.  Good family movie üçø.  I would recommend to watch.

"Glad I gave this a chance. Genuinely enjoyed it. It channels a similar vibe to films I grew up watching, like Gremlins, Jurassic Park, and ET. And while this may not have the staying power of those classics, I enjoyed it for all the same reasons. The great looking characters, the immersive world building, and storytelling that is fun and accessible for all ages. 

Some point of how far it strays from the darker tone of the source material, which is a fair complaint given how highly thought of the source material is. Although, I watched this with my 5-year old and he's still talking about it a couple of days later, and I'm a sucker for seeing my kid connect with a film like he did this one, and the way I did with the films I mentioned above.

What a waste of world building. It had so much potential but instead it‚Äôs just soulless. ,1
"Entertaining enough, with a very cheesy ending.",3
"It was earth shattering or mind blowing, but it was an enjoyable movie to watch with the family. I enjoyed the nostalgic robots, especially Mr. Peanut. I can watch Chris Pratt, Stanly Tucci and Millie in anything they are cast in. The movie may not win Oscar's,  but it afforded us a fun night together. ",4
 Personally enjoyed it don't see what all the hate was about ,5
It is such a fun movie with all its great concepts and big cast not sure it needed 320 mil to come out but the CGI is fantastic.,5

"As a sci-fi enthusiast and dreamer, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! It takes you on an thrilling ride filled with action and excitement. While the story could have explored more of its potential, the fast pace and strong performances kept me entertained from start to finish. Highly recommended for anyone looking for an engaging adventure!",4.5
The Electric State is one of the most fun movies I‚Äôve seen in a while. Its combination of CGI and use of practical sets really set itself apart from movies that only use it 100%. Extremely immersive and moving plots. I have no negative to say and to see people dislike it only shows how many have become too afraid to have fun in life that they can‚Äôt let go of reality for just one second to enjoy what was a really fun and moving movie. Bravo Russo brothers and everyone involved in the creation of this piece!,5
"I think this movie was wonderful.
The Cast is good and the book Story is also 
beautiful. But the Thing is the Art from the book 
was much better than the art in the movie",4
"Very entertaining and visually stunning, great world building. Sure it's not perfect, and I get the critiques people are putting out there. But that was a very cool looking and enjoyable movie and worth your time!!",4.5
This is one of the rare times audience score being higher than critics score is off. This was just a boring slog. Had potential but the plot was just dumb. Even Chris Pratt couldn't save this one.,2
"Even though the the electric state is no Godfather it does provide interesting world building and simple story that is intertaining. The only minus about the movie is that it's messaging us a little hamfisted, but it's a Netflix show that's based on a larger graphic novel series that had more time to make a larger impact.",3.5
Get over yourself - it‚Äôs fun. ,5
Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt performances were awesome! The movie is wonderful made!,5
"I watched it as a 72 year old kid and  had a great time.
 Fairly good movie to watch with your kids
If you dont watch it as an adult critic and just enjoy the show.
Good effects,good actors,good subject,some violence.",3.5
"Why all the hate? I‚Äôve seen much worse movies, and I would definitely watch this again. Characters are developed enough, interesting plot.. and so on. Came here to write a review because I‚Äôm confused why Ive heard such bad things about it now that I‚Äôve actually seen it. ",3.5
"If you can get by MBB flat delivery and awkward body language, the movie is a solid 'dollar rental'.  StarLord is well, StarLord.  The visuals gave this an extra star.

"It's been a long time since I've seen a movie like this.
Simple but absolutely profound, actors perfect for their roles, amazing visuals without being exaggerated (or being the center of the film) and nostalgic robots used as a pretext to recover fundamental values, now forgotten.
Watch it, you will really go back to the wonderful and simple 90s.
You will not regret it",5
"Anyone telling you to ‚Äúturn off your brain‚Äù or just be entertained by sounds and colors must think you‚Äôre 2 years old. This movie is bad - god forbid you read the book, you would have a burning hatred for just how bad it actually is. ",1

"People need a chill pill... just sit, pop up some popcorn and some soda and watch a goodamed movie for laughs or to have a good time... EVERYTHING nowadays needs to be THE THING WITH THAT WEIGHT AND DRAMA AND TWIST... The movie is FUN...

"The critics are right; The Electric State is a bit flat when it comes to building its characters' emotions and the underlying dystopian politics. It is, nevertheless, a decent sci-fi adventure with action and humor throughout. I recommend watching it with your kids between 9 and 15 if you are the type of parent that doesn't mind PG-13 action violence and language.

Or just watch it when you want something heavier than a sitcom but still a kind of light.",4
The electric state is not a bad movie by itself. The story is not badly written but very predictable but it‚Äôs not unwatchable. The CGI is really good and give a lot of personality to every robots. The movie doesn‚Äôt deserve what ‚Äúcritics‚Äù are rating.,3.5
Amazing and underestimated movie. From a swedish perspective it is exactly how St√•lenhagens world should be depicted. The movie was fantastic in visuals and chartacter development. I will tho say that I personally would have made some big changes but all in all it is a great movie for both young and old. My kids love it and I was pleased as well. I dont think people understand it when they rate it as bad. You should not see this movie with any expectations and just enjoy it for what it is. It is new and different and should be appreciated as such.,5
"When do the critics ever get it right? Not a blockbuster, but very watchable. CGI is very believable. Pratt is his usual best. Brown delivers an ok performance. The robots were very charismatic but some could be a little annoying. Story was predictable but worth the watch IMO. ",3.5
"Once again, the Russo brothers are unfairly maligned due to past successes; for whatever reason (*cough being expected to deliver the same level of impact as a string of movies that benefitted from the good will and backstories of many other movies before them cough*), their movies get a consistently bad rap and I‚Äôm left wondering if reviewers (the pros at least) are watching the same thing I am. 

It‚Äôs fine! Are the story beats rote? Sure! Do you know exactly where this is going? Of course! But there is a place in every diet for a little mac and cheese every now and then. This is comfort food of the highest order with flawless special effects and just enough fun moments to make it a good hang. You‚Äôre not writing home about this but you‚Äôre not going to regret it either. This isn‚Äôt Kraft Mac and cheese out of the blue box, either, this is the premium kind they throw in the oven first at a chain restaurant. Enjoy! ",3
"Absolutely fantastic movie. It's simply well done from all sides. It has a proper story and character development. It's original and unique, the effects are absolutely fantastic and the acting is well done.",5
"When I first heard about this movie, my eyes lit up, my mouth salivated, my metal-gear rose, my snake went solid, and I was dying to take a gander at this cool looking robot world. But then a few moons past and me (still having 2 glorious, unwasted hours of my life and yet to behold this movie) began hearing some of the negative backlash from critics. I (foolishly) thought, ""hey, this movie can't be THAT bad. I mean the budget is big enough to be the GDP of several small nations, surely it can't be THAT bad and soulless with the amount of money and resources that was put into this movie, right?"" Somehow this movie had gained an intriguing quality to me, it had become the forbidden fruit. I was lured to take a bite by the cool world and robot design, but was quickly brought back to reality and punished by the story (or more appropriately, lack thereof) and the characters. Firstly, let's discuss the story. This story is drier than women after looking at me. It has the flavor of stale bread. But unlike stale bread which can keep you fed for two hours, this movie sucks two hours of your valuable time on this planet and throws it directly in the shitter. No processing and dissection of this movie's information is needed because frankly, there's nothing to dissect and digest. This plot is more predictable than Mario saving the princess, or Bowser kidnapping her for the millionth time. But unlike Mario's adventures which are filled with fun, memorable events, this is just so bland. I mean where the hell did all the budget go??? Clearly not on writers. Secondly, let's discuss the characters. Idk if this is just me but I've felt that Millie Bobby Brown's character (Michelle) and Woody Norman's character (Christopher) had an extremely unrealistic sibling relationship. Even before their parents died, I got more bf/gf vibes than sibling vibes. Are the writers must all have been only-child people, because in what world are siblings that lovey-dovey? I'm just now realizing that this rant of a review has gotten too long so I'm just gonna get to the TL;DR: Great concept, poorly executed. The world and design looks cool, but the way it's presented and shown along with the story is just soooo lame and feels like wasted potential.",2
"First off the VFX are crazy good, the story is a little bit boring as it's the classic; Humans make robots, robots get feelings, humans and robots fight, however I didn't absolutely hate it.

I loved the robot designs and their personalities.

Overall it wasn't a terrible movie but wasn't anything otherworldly, funny at times and visually stunning.",3
"Really not that bad of a movie lol. Great to watch and be entertained by on a rainy day. Could be much better as the idea and concept is there but could have made it not so directed towards children. Also, Milly Bobby brown is just simply not a good actor‚Ä¶ not believable and just has no appeal. Got the casting wrong. ",3
"Toller leichter Film. 
Die Tricktechnik ist herausragend. Die Schauspieler machen alle einen gutem Job. Die Story ist manchmal etwas unlogisch aber gut. Das Setting ist gut umgesetzt. 
Ich weiss nicht, warum die Kritiker den Film zerrei√üen aber ein seelenloses Actiongeballer feiern.",5
"Not a good movie, very childish, not good customes and neither good effects.",1
"I have always enjoyed films and have thought until recently that I was usually in agreement with the crowd. Recently I watched Anora with my wife. We rarely agree on films but this Oscar winner left us both cold - tedious, hysterical and lacking an ounce of humour, unless you like unfunny slapstick.

So I saw the grim reviews for Electric State and expected nothing. It is not a great film, but it is everything Anora was not - likeable characters, actual humour, decent script and entertaining: perhaps also the trolls and The Daily Mail might get off the back of Millie Bobby Brown ",3.5
May not appeal to the John Wick crowd. Think vintage Zemeckis or Spielberg here. Novel story line. Entertaining. Well acted. Anything with Stanley Tucci gets elevated automatically. Great effects. Music by veteran alumni Silvestri. This is a big budget summer popcorn flick.  Great fun with a nice balance of message and humor.  It's well worth a look in these troubled times. ,4
"I really enjoyed it. Light evening entertainment. 
Very watchable and great concept. Loved the whole thing. 

Much better than the borderlands movie which is quite similar. 
Br",5
I liked it and I don't care what the critics say. ,5
The worst movie of 2025 so far. I don't even understand where they use 300 million dollars in making this movie. The script is bad. I almost fell asleep when I reach half of the runtime. A waste of time.,1
The TikToks you watched while it was on don't count towards your rating of this movie.,1.5
"A well-packaged product, masterfully polished, but which does not convey anything.
Atmosphere reminiscent of Tales from the Loop but in a schizophrenic and forcedly comic version.",3
"The most interesting characters are the robots, and they look fantastic.  The plot is a bit lacking.",3
Nothing spectacular.  Forgot it a few days later.,3
"Don‚Äôt listen to the haters. Between the stars‚Äô charisma, the retro futuristic charm (reminiscent of Fallout), and good old-fashioned movie action, this film is a load of fun. ",5
Thoughly enjoyed it. Great story,5
"It was a funny and enjoyable movie,  I liked it ",5
"Predictable and easy to forget plot, paper-thin characters",2
"I rarely see movies nowadays but I always have a soft spot for well executed science fiction. This movie brings me back to my childhood of reading and watching anything related to that. It's not perfect but it doesn't have to be. Great visuals, dialogs and acting. The critics hate it maybe because it's not deep or complicated enough for them but for me it's a great movie to watch with your family on the weekends.",5
"If you are interested in the aesthetics, which is the only thing that barely translates from the source material, i highly recommend you go pick the art book instead of wasting a second of your life on this. 

Also, you can trust the critics on this one, 15% seems spot on from what i get from people. Without even being familiar with the source material, mostly everyone agrees this is a bad marvel movie wannabe. I don't know where the 76% audience score comes from, but it certainly does not reflect how the audience feels, and i am certain Netflix did something fishy there",0.5
"I would say ,that for  something like Netflix where rarely anything good is placed and same films are recycled and re used again,it was a fresh,fun and different breath of fresh air and getting to see/hear some Disney/Marvel known actors was quite good..story although bit plain and missing a bit of that "" Avengers assemble Infinity war vibe"" by the Russo brothers,was quite good and suitable for 6 to 60 audiences.",4
This movie was great all the movie critics shouldn't even have jobs because they suck at there jobs they should all be fired ,5
"I was interested to see this and I wanted to love it.  However, I wasn't mad at this movie after seeing it.  I was just disappointed by it.  Disappointed by it in more ways than one. There are a couple of things that worked, in my opinion.  Just to see the Russo Brothers themselves direct a movie that was based on a graphic novel of the same name in their own vision does feel like it was lost in translation.
Getting the positives out of the way.  One of them has to got to the visual effects and yes, there is some creativity going on with the robots and how we're living in a world where we had gone through a war against robots who have grown self-aware.  Even see that the robots were living a better life as time went by.  It is also interesting to see where humans would put themselves into a state of isolation and self-absorbed in an electric sleep through VR and whatnot.  Even the voice cast that was given to the robots were good if you looked up the cast line.
The other positive I can give is that some of the acting is okay.  Even give Millie Bobby Brown credit for going through the trouble of finding her brother thanks to a little robot that looks like a mascot of a cartoon they grew up with.  For the record, her scenes are better with the emotion that she was going through as well as how the ending went.  We do miss our loved ones and would like to see them again.
Unfortunately, if only the story focuses on them more than what you've seen.  Being pursued like it's a catch that kid kind of style to finding out some truths to a war.  It's a messy story when you think about it.  The script doesn't help the actors either with most of the scenes dragging on.  It's a two hour long movie, too.  I enjoyed some parts, even that little war and the sentimental moments, but for the rest of the film, it felt very dull.
I don't think I'll think about watching this again in the future.  Rather, I might check out the graphic novel in the future as this movie was based on it.  I'm gonna give this film four Woody Harrelson as Mr. Peanut out of ten.  4/10.",2
"Loved this movie clean, funny and family friendly ",5
"The Electric State was definitely one of more entertaining movies I‚Äôve seen recently, which is why I didn‚Äôt give it a one star. The issue I have with this movie is it seems like they just asked Chat GPT to write a script for a robot version of Ready Player One. It has an extremely similar plot and the same exact ending, I‚Äôm not even kidding. Both movies have a greedy CEO antagonist, civilians are on VR all the time, and they didn‚Äôt even use Chat GPT on the ending they literally just copied and pasted it. However I did think some of the characters were cool like the old baseball robot, and the jokes were good so it still might be worth a watch.",3
"If you like sci-fi books and movies, this movie is definitely for you. Action, sentimental and overall an entertaining movie.",4.5
"This film was a great watch. I'm amazed by the difference between critics and a normal viewer, I expected a rubbish terrible film, yet what I got was a funny, well written story with some great actors and performances.
I actually truly enjoyed electric state. Well worth a watch and if you like sci fi then even better ",5
Very grateful movie I loved how the story catches the attention and actually makes since and the lil robots and Mr peanut was amazing ü•≤ all the way through and loved the color and just was a long waited movie for me I miss movies like this ,5
"I'm a sci-fi fan and enjoyed lots of the MCU, but this was just visually expensive trash. It's like someone plugged the premis into an AI and threw money at it. It has the plot and dialogue equivalents of a poor quality machine generated image with wierd bits missing.

American films can tend to dumb down any emotional and intellectual content, but this was just sad knuckle draging cringe. It's best watched with the sound off so you can enjoy the visuals without getting traumatised by the awful the storyline, blatant plot holes, lame dialogue and sentimental nonsense.",1
"This movie did exactly what all movies should do. It entertained from start to finish. It was funny and emotional. Critics take movies too seriously, enjoy a movie for the entertainment it offers and you won‚Äôt be disappointed. ",5
"I am beginning to think that I am going to watch every crap reviewed movie critics give.  They were way off on this one.  This was a fun movie with a unique concept.  Definitely in agreement with the other movie watchers.  Check it out for yourself.  Solid performance from Chris Pratt and the crew.
",5
"Funny the disconnect between ""official"" reviews and normal people.  Not sure if they expect everything to be groundbreaking, but simple songs resonate for a reason.  I thought it was a good watch, great acting and voicework, and an emotional story.  Movies are supposed to make us feel, be emotional and think about being better.  This checks those boxes.  ",5
Idk what the critic are on. Yall need to take a chill pill and have some fun. its such a fun movie to watch lol. Yall too serious for this.,5
I thought it was a fun movie with a cool concept!  Very enjoyable and I‚Äôd watch it again:),4
"Nice üëçüèΩ movie very good performance 
I am enjoying so much ",5
"Critics got this one wrong ‚Äî super fun watch. A few solid laughs, fun story, and it pays off in the end. I think people take for granted how hard it is to make a movie this good. Great cast too. ",5
"Highly entertaining, cool world and awsome speciall effects. I really liked it.",5
"Went in with low expectations based on the reviews, but it was better than I thought it was going to be.  It was riddled with plot holes and character development was limited but it has good actors and good acting.   Overall I thought it was an entertaining movie and worth the watch.",3.5
"I went in expecting to turn this off after the caneing it got on a few of my favorite utube reviewers but i dont get all the hate, i enjoyed Electric State sure it has a few faults but as far as good entertainment goes it was fun ,the robots are great and i really liked some of them the cgi is top notch guess thats where a lot of the money went .The story meh but just sit back relax and enjoy some light hearted action scfi.",4
"The Electric State is an expensive giant blob of garbage. With a cool concept and neat looking robot designs you think this movie would be a hit right? Turns out the story is the most generic, forgettable thing you could lay your eyes on. The film tries to hit you in the feels and build sympathy for these characters, but it doesn‚Äôt help when the film is overstuffed with poorly timed comedic jokes, and a cast that is filled with unlimited talent but just comes off as underwhelming. I love the Russo brothers and the production that went into this movie, but if this is the kind of slop they are going to deliver going forward, I will be heavily disappointed. Some fun moments here and there but I can‚Äôt recommend this movie",1.5
"‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è (5/5)

The Electric State is an incredible sci-fi movie with amazing visuals and a heartfelt story. Millie Bobby Brown does a fantastic job, and the world feels both mysterious and beautiful. It‚Äôs got action, emotion, and a unique style that pulls you in. Definitely worth watching!",5
This is a must see.  All the critics here are out of sync.  To the writers it would have been nice to see the start being a movie in itself.  Would have a Terminator vibe with AI and the real world.  I love it and can get into the concept of a brain uploading into a robot.  Enough said just open your mind a bit ,5
"It's not as egregiously dumb as I was led to believe, but #TheElectricState doesn't quite raise the bar for robot-AI films either. It looks pretty (and should given its reported budget) & at least has a cohesive storyline. But otherwise it's as paint by numbers as you can expect.",1.5
I am now a rotten tomato critic. This movie sucked ass. I got mad watching this.,0.5
What is wrong with the critics? This was a great movie. Great scenery. Great acting by entire cast. Much better than recent movies at the theater.,5
Excellent family friendly movie. A story with heart and great visuals. If you are a sci-fi fan you'll love it. Great alternate time-line story set in the 1990s. ,5
I've read the book and it was much darker and more sinister which really stood out so I thought the movie would be just as good and unfortunately and I know that sounds weird but the movie was too upbeat and happy for the dystopian source material I think the special effects was well done but the cast was just distant not emotionally connected,2.5
"A Mesmerizing, Emotional Masterpiece That Critics Clearly Missed. (No Spoilers Review)

The fact that the critics don‚Äôt see this as a good movie is the exact reason they are out of touch.

It‚Äôs rare for a film to feel both intimate and epic, personal yet vast, but The Electric State pulls it off effortlessly. The Russo brothers have delivered a visually breathtaking, emotionally resonant journey that critics, in their rush to nitpick, have somehow failed to appreciate.

Let‚Äôs be clear, this film is not just another sci-fi blockbuster. It‚Äôs a story dripping with heart, anchored by Millie Bobby Brown‚Äôs phenomenal performance. Her portrayal of Michelle, a girl navigating a decayed, retro-futuristic America alongside her endearing, lumbering robot companion feels raw and real, pulling the audience deep into her personal odyssey of loss, hope, and survival. There‚Äôs an undeniable emotional weight here, a haunting loneliness that lingers long after the credits roll.

Visually? Stunning. The world-building is top-tier, seamlessly blending nostalgic 1980s aesthetics with eerie dystopian landscapes. Every frame feels meticulously crafted, bursting with painterly compositions straight out of Simon St√•lenhag‚Äôs visionary artwork. The cinematography immerses you in a world that‚Äôs both beautiful and tragic. It is something today‚Äôs critics seem to take for granted.

The tension builds naturally, the set pieces feel earned, and the film respects its audience enough to let emotion drive the stakes rather than mindless spectacle. It is chillingly atmospheric, pulling every scene together with an emotional undercurrent that grips you at your core.

So why the lukewarm critical response? Because too many critics today seem to mistake loud for good and fast-paced for well-made. They ignore a film‚Äôs soul in favor of artificial pacing demands, and The Electric State refuses to dumb itself down. Instead, it‚Äôs a deeply human story wrapped in an otherworldly setting. One that trusts its audience to actually feel something.

Ignore the critics. This is cinema at its most poignant, a film that deserves to be experienced on the biggest screen possible. If you‚Äôre looking for mindless spectacle, go elsewhere. But if you want a movie that will stick with you, one that blends breathtaking visuals with genuine emotion, The Electric State is a journey worth taking.

Final verdict? A modern sci-fi classic that will age far better than its early naysayers.",5
"This movie is amazing the acting the plot everything it‚Äôs my favorite one it has all the emotions, I rate it a 10/10",5
"Whoof.  If you're tired of studios pushing out terrible ""content"" like this nowadays, look to the audience who have such obviously low standards such that they accept this tripe.  ",2
If the audience had any idea what they were watching this would get 20% max. What a terrible attempt to make anything out of the electric state. Chris pratt?? really? if you have never heard of the electric state you don't know what you are missing. it's like watching a new star wars movie you'd think it's bad because they are but if it was your first movie ever with no contect you may give it a 6/10 still bad but not as bad if you have any idea what you are watching. ,1
"I really don't understand the hate of the critics towards this film but I definitely enjoyed it. The back story of the robots, the over all story, the characters especially chris pratt and his friend robot, for me they were the ones that i enjoyed watching their interactions. I was just kinda surprised about the budget when i saw it and think they could have extend the story more but over all it didn't affect my enjoyment of the movie. Definitely recommend watching it",4
"I saw this recommended on Netflix and never heard of it before. I didn't even look at who the stars were. I am surprised that I recognized the main female actor because SHE can act. That is the only reason why I gave this 1 star. She is amazing. (Can't remember her name - just know her from Stranger Things.)

This started off very strong and then...what happened...not much. None of the characters reached out to me. The story was really just a short story. I was so bored that I had keep pausing it after 10 - 20 minutes or I would lose interest and forget what they just said and had to rewind it.

I am now very wary of anything recommended for me on Netflix. I haven't found much of actual interest.",1.5
"I enjoyed the movie.  Not sure why the critics are so harsh but hey I do not look too critically at movies like I am tasting a wine and trying to find all the notes.  The only thing I wished there had been more of was humor, Chris Pratt brought it as usual but the film could have used more.",4
The movie was watchable and fun battle scene though. The start was a little out hand but it does have great outcome. ,3
"Es original, da un mensaje potente y entretiene",4.5
I don't know why the critics hate this movie so much - I enjoyed it - I found the actors compelling to watch and the story was interesting! Don't let the bad reviews put you off... ,5
"Tem umas partes muito ruins, aquela com o pai adotivo √© muito chata, os personagens s√£o rasos e h√° uns di√°logos expositivos chatos e o roteiro perde peso ao desfazer os sacrif√≠cios que os personagens fazem. Mas tem uns momentos legais e uma hist√≥ria ok. √â mediocre. N√£o √© o melhor filme do mundo como alguns disseram, mas n√£o √© o esgoto radioativo que a critica est√° dizendo.",2
The ai in the movie is apparently in it.. but I had fun watching it. It a good movie. ,3.5
"Not as bad as some are making out. After a long difficult day at work this was just right. Not overly taxing or thought provoking. The dialogue, delivery and direction were a little flat. Great visuals. Didn't learn anything about myself or the universe. Aimed at a younger audience. Chris Pratt raises the level. ",2.5
I am just amazed how the actors in this thing are more one dimensional and less interesting than their robot counterparts. It is as if the actors were told to be no more than props in service to showcase some cool graphics,0.5
I personally enjoyed the movie. The effects were amazing and the visuals were wow! The story line was interesting and i love the underlying message. It‚Äôs funny/silly whilst being a reflection of today‚Äôs society. The two leads are amazing and the voice actor of the robots are incredible. ,4.5
Best film I‚Äôve seen in a long time time. Soak it up and enjoy. ,5
I‚Äôm a fan of Chris Pratt but this movie was very predictable and the script seemed like it was written by AI. ,2.5
"Truly unwatchable. I'm surprised that they can't make a film that tells a story without resorting to noisy, chaotic unassembled jumble of scenes. What a disappointment. ",1
"Tiene buen√≠simos efectos especiales, los dise√±os y atm√≥sfera est√°n bien logrados. Lamentablemente los di√°logos son bastante planos, lo cual afecta enormemente a los personajes, ya que algunos logran ser interesantes, pero no √∫nicos. Esto esto da la sensaci√≥n de un reciclaje hecho por inteligencia artificial que le resta muchos puntos.

C√≥mo sea es disfrutable para ver en familia o para aquellos amantes de las historias steampunk futuristas.",3
"It was amusing enough.  The special effects were really good, giving this world where robots coexisted with humans a sense of scale and reality.  It had some fun action sequences and neat visuals.  Some of the character interactions were fun to watch, especially between Chris Pratt's character and his robot side-kick.

The biggest weakness of the movie is how derivative it is.  Everything seems like it has been done better in another movie, and the casting is so on-the-nose.  Chris Pratt plays a Chris Pratt type character, Stanley Tucci plays a Stanley Tucci type character, Ke Huy Quan plays a Ke Huy Quan type character, Millie Bobby Brown plays a Millie Bobby Brown type character...it was almost like the entire movie was written and cast by AI.

I didn't hate it.  It is entertaining fluff, with some good production design, and cute characters.  But that's about it.

 ",3
Baby Herman is my favorite part,5
Just boring‚Ä¶what a waste of a movie,1.5
Pretty bad for me.  Seems like an AI developed the script and scenes.  My famlity watched it together so I had to sit through the whole thing.  Given a choice I would have stopped watching it personally.,1
"Masterpiece for me. First of all, the story flow is good. Second, the details of how the robots are made. Some people say that they are ""ugly when made with robots"" and ""colorless"". They didn't think about the theme of the robots. [1, it's been too long since they've finished the war. 2, the robots have been neglected so the colors are just lifelike, and they look rusty.] Third, to the performers. Chris Pratt, still acting flawlessly. He still brings a little comedy to his character, and for the others who are acting, there is just a little disappointment. But it's okay because some scenes are overdone. This is good for friends to watch. As for children, parental guidance is still needed. üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº (standing ovation) üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº",5
These movie is not the worst movie ever made but I think it was a good film i wish it had less AI but the plot was the real reason i continue watching it was so interesting ,3
Ignore the bs critics. It's a good watch with a good story. My kids enjoyed it as did the rest of the family.,4.5
It‚Äôs underrated it has great fight scenes and the final battle was amazing good acting as well ,5
"De verdad no puedo entender a los supuestos cr√≠ticos de cine que solo sirven para defenestrar una pel√≠cula que es bastante divertida y agradable de ver, eso me convence m√°s y m√°s que la cr√≠tica especializada solo son grupo de viejos amargados a los que no les gusta nada a menos que sea una porquer√≠a como Emilia P√©rez.  La pel√≠cula cuenta una historia que poco se ve hoy en d√≠a, de amor fraternal donde una chica quiere salvar a su hermano y en el camino conoce personas y robots valientes que la ayudar√°n en su cometido. Los personajes rob√≥ticos son simp√°ticos y agradables, Millie Bobby Brown hace un muy buen papel donde demuestra que no solo es la ni√±a ps√≠quica de Stranger Things, siempre es un placer ver a Chris Pratt salvando el d√≠a, de verdad me gusta mucho su personaje en esta pel√≠cula. 

En conclusi√≥n la recomiendo mucho si quieres pasar un buen rato en familia.",5
It was cute and funny but the whole premise is kind of dumb. Also main lead looks way too old to be in high school.,3
"Netflix you've done it again.  They have basically become an agent for why theaters need to stay in business.  Streaming services cannot make movies, case in point.  It's the bargain box of movies at walmart. I don't know exactly why this doesn't click for me, but I have some ideas. I think the story is disjointed, we don't really care about the characters except for HRM.  The robots and the effects are cool, but it just doesn't flow well.   Honestly Millie Bobby Brown was a bust in this, this might confirm she's just not a good actor or maybe simply this was not the role for her.  Is she only good in Stranger Things because she says little and just makes faces?  Either way, very disappointing but par for the course for Netflix.",2.5
"I really enjoyed this - thought the visuals and music were great, and the story engaging!",4
"Just honestly a complete waste of time and money. All around just a bad and uninteresting movie‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs a shame. 

The world is uninteresting and bland with rushed exposition and the character motives are equally so. 

The cast makes attempts, but fall flat and the overall self serious and yet ‚Äúfunny‚Äù tone clash constantly. Visuals are adequate but again, just nothing special. It took me three viewings to finally get through it and that‚Äôs ultimately the worst offense. It‚Äôs a slog and just not an enjoyable film to view.",0.5
"This movie was so ho-hum it is laughable.  It started out strong for the first ten minutes or so, when it did its montage to get the viewer up to speed on the world created in the movie, but after that it descended into mediocrity.  The Russo Brothers basically hired Pratt, input some Guardians of the Galaxy type music, and made this a mediocre Marvel movie.  This is one of the few times I totally agree with the  Critics.  It had no original vision to offer, all the dialogue and characters were 1-dimensional as could be.",0.5
"Some nice ideas. Mostly a discombobulated mess. 

Imagine someone taking scripts from, say, Galaxy Quest, Short Circuit and other such movies.
Then using an early chat GDQPTSTRSSHVXAE loaded on a Commodore 64k 1980's games console and ordering it to write, direct and act in it.

I just hope this is not supposed to be a metaphor for servile races coming to age, through the ages. If it is, this is truly not worth the ash of a one star rating.

FInal thought....I liked the Mr. Peanut character.",1.5
"Cute little movie.  Nothing earth shattering or something that will stay with you down the road but not a bad waste of a couple of hours.  Much better than a lot of the crap that is produced these days.  Sure, the robots might have been the most engaging characters in the film but . . . it is what it is.  The world building wasn't bad but could have been fleshed out a bit more.",3.5
"This was one of the most disappointing movies I‚Äôve seen lately. I love the source material and I recommend that if you also enjoy it, go check out Tales from the Loop and hard pass on this AI written slop. ",0.5
Me deixou um pouco perdida mas eu adorei os efeitos visuais e atua√ß√£o n√£o deixou muito a desejar,3.5
Chris Pratt is the most entertaining actor in Hollywood today. Another great movie. Can't trust critics when it comes to comedy. ,5
"The critics are dramatically insane! The Electric State is a fun movie with a great soundtrack! I now have ""I Fought The Law"" by The Clash stuck in my head. üòè",5
"Really enjoyed this movie, don't understand why some of the negative reviews, people just need to stop being so negative and uptight ",5
"Personally, we thought The Electric State was an incredible movie with a very timely message for the current digital age we are living in. An enjoyable experience from start to finish filled with plenty of heart, humour, comraderie, and emotional stakes. Well done to the cast & crew for their effort, we're happy we gave this a chance. The movie did not disappoint!",5
I really enjoyed it. It made for a good laugh.,5
"A great film to watch with the family on a Saturday night. Kids will love this. I don‚Äôt understand the negative reviews. Lots of action, good acting with cute robots. ",5
"Boring garbage, bad dialogues, bad acting, seems like actors felt ridiculous and we sense it. Not for children but too childish and boring to be for adults. Forces you to fastforward many scenes, what never happened to me with S-F film.",0.5
"Bad , give me back my 2hrs , horrible acting and no chemistry at all",0.5
Did they really spend three hundred million dollars to make this film? The price tag boggles the mind for a streaming film. Critics have been very unkind to the movie but I think us regular folks will enjoy it. It's not the best film by far but it's also not the worst. ,3
"Movie is absolute garbage. Should be taken off all platforms and forgotten. 
If I could rate it a zero, I would. And that's being generous",0.5
"The movie uses generative AI.
That allone is a nogo.

I really liked the Art Book this movie is based on, but the movie is nothing compared to it.
Doesn't give the vibe at all. Not the same mesage.
Just another movie like so many more.

Worthless",0.5
"The critics are right this time. Hard to believe that these hollywood big shots came together and spend so much money on the worst movie of the year. 

I now know why some studios cancel movies even after spending so much money. Some movies are never meant to be released.",0.5
I don't understand all the hate. Watched it with my kids (16 & 20) and we all really enjoyed it. Had some great music and a few laugh out loud moments. ,3.5
"The movie isn't bad. It plays out like a summer blockbuster, with action and lots of special effects. It's not a bad story. 

My big problem with it is that Simon Stalenhag's The Electric State, 2018, is a FAR more compelling and terrifying story. There are hints of it here and there in the film. Lifeless people with headsets on, so hooked into the system their mouths hang and fingers twitch, but no one is home. Crumbling ruins of civilization. The war backstory.

In the book, everyone was slowly sapped into the terminals, leaving their bodies kept alive barely by the sentry headsets. And the machines themselves are slowly melding together to form something unknown.

The movie looks almost as if they started out filming it closer to the book ... then changed to the more marketable popcorn movie we got.

It's not a bad movie. But the book is more cerebral, scary, and thought providing to the point the movie feels ... Disappointing. It's nothing like the book at all aside for asthenic and the name. ",3
"I think critics have become so disconnected with life and just simple enjoyment, movie watching used to be an escape, 2 hours freedom from reality. We could let our imaginations have fun and find our own connections with characters in stories now it‚Äôs about finding ways to find flaws in everything and everyone. Was this movie amazing no but it was fun and interesting and worth the watch absolutely yes it was! To think all the bad ‚Äúimportant critics reviews‚Äù almost had me shy away from watching is sad but now I'm starting to avoid so many more critics and giving them my views with hope these depressed individuals will start to slowly disappear and have no voice that can ruin others hard work.",4
CGI is great. I love Chris Pratts interaction with the robots but story isnt great. I wouldnt watch it again. ,1.5
"Going in my biggest concern was the movie was going to try and take itself seriously. Sadly, it does. There's plenty of nostalgia and CGI combined with a laughably overly dramatic soundtrack, all desperately hoping to distract you from bad writing, bad acting and overall lazy, lazy filmmaking. 

This makes most of the mindless garbage that comes to theaters seem like a vintage Disney classic by comparison.",0.5
"Not a bad movie the acting and cgi are good,  but the movie dragged in spots. Would still recommend watching. ",3
I thought it was good. Pratt is excellent too,4
This movie is a fun family watch. It‚Äôs really funny!,5
"Yet again another reason you shouldn‚Äôt listen to critic reviews. Me and my girlfriend LOVED this movie. 90‚Äôs nostalgia PEAK, this was a fun ride, funny moments, a little cheesy on the emotional stuff but in a good way. Perfect for a pizza night with your girl.",5
"Filme gen√©rico, n√£o justifica o valor de produ√ß√£o e da pra assistir no 2.50x sem perder nada do filme.",1
"Could not even finish it in the comfort of my home. Really? Who wrote this silliness? A 7 yr old? (ok, did not mean to insult 7 yr olds......)
Cartoonish without the fun part. And they spent a fortune on it! Who directed that?....the Kardashians?

So there.",4
"this movie is based on the work of simon st√•lenhag. That being said, its a good movie because it respects the story behind it, that also means its light weight story and you should expect something in that direction, not a revolutionary movie, but a funny easy to see and also visual intriguing since the author has a very unique vision of the future. If you liked it, there is also tales from the loop which is a another work from him",5
"Cute movie with an interesting premise, good acting & cast, and a final act that just DRAGS. The pacing of the story was great up until the final act where it slows down to a crawl. It really made it a chore to finish because I had grown attached to the characters and the plot, but it was a story that could have been told in 1hr 45 or even 1hr 30min. ",2
"It's a fine movie, visually it's wonderful and it pops when it needs to.
It's not a movie that's meant to make you think, and it's message is fairly clear. Give it a watch, enjoy the ride, enjoy the nostalgia and have fun.",3.5
"An enjoyable story, not boring, it's a joy for sci-fi fans, exploring and commenting on virtual reality and society without sermonizing. The plot moves along with a few glitches and voila, you have enjoyed your time.
Praise for ""the Stranger Things girl"" portraying her character convincingly. ",3.5
"I had a hard time maintaining my interest in this one. It took a couple of days to finish. Lots of ingenious effects. Great scenery. Storyline muddled. Main players did well. Touching brother and sister story in a post robotic apocalyptic world and being ""adopted"" by a would-be big brother along the way. The reported $300M production cost doesn't really show on the screen and it's always amazing how such projects and budgets get green-lighted by Netflix. Some of their standard players and creative contributors from other projects are also present for this one--to varying results.",3
"Disclaimer: I am not a fan of sci-fi movies, but this one changed my mind.

Dystopian, Heartfelt, Nostalgic, Goofy all wrapped in to one movie. 

I felt like the acting was pretty good and script was sharp. 

Don't listen to the negative reviews from top critics, they are just bitter.",5
"Extremely boring, story was very weak from the start and couldn't get pass the first half hour, switched to HBO.",1
"It was a really good movie!!! Really recommend it to watch, probably one of my favourite. ",5
"Don't listen to the critics. This had a good story, a bit of heart, and was well put together. There was a good message about unplugging and living life. I really liked it a lot. Go watch it, it's worth it. ",5
"A great family adventure about friendship, family, and connection.   Funny, heartfelt, adventurous with a wild assortment of characters.  Totally underrated. ",5
Chris Pratt showed up in this movie just in time to make it totally not suck. The emotional energy fell flat. Chris character was the best by far. The soundtrack was good and a couple of the bots were fun but the brother/sister connection just didn‚Äôt really sell. Thanks Chris Pratt for being awesome!! Lead with this guy next time Russo brothers. ,3
This movie is terrible ,1.5
Absolutely brilliant plot with a theme that is scarily close to our current time. There were some cringy parts and had a slow starting but the ending battle was great.,5

La storia forse un po' cos√¨ cos√¨.....scontata.....ma ambientazione üîù",4
"C‚Äômon. This wasn‚Äôt that bad. Nice characters, a decent baddie and‚Ä¶ ROBOTS! Really cool robots! I don‚Äôt know how or why some people were confused by this movie. It was pretty straightforward. It was a little like Ready Player One, but not as fun. And they spent waaay too much money making it. But an enjoyable flick.",3

"This movie doesn't scream best movie of 2025, but the critics are being a little harsh. The movie was very well put together and the only downfall was the ending. ",4
"I grew up an electric state fan, playing inspired video games online. This blockbuster budget has all the special effects to match, the robots even felt landed and real in each scene.

But the story was so without a real heart or inspiration, when it would muster up a nostalgic memory it felt like they ticked it off their to-do list.

It's worth an evening, but not an amazing one. Props to acting, music, sound and vfx but your writers let you down.",3.5
Honestly one of the best 2025 movies!,5
"The production design is truly unique! The general plot is fairly imaginative as well, which makes the whole film a refreshingly original experience. These days, original is rare, which is why i wish more movies like this were being made.",5
"I thought the movie was fun to watch, had a little slow part every once in awhile, but more fun to watch than most shoot 'em ups. Great ending and good commentary on the state of our world even now.",5
"An eerie, captivating science-fiction illustrated book turned into an overstuffed, way-overpriced Russo Brothers CGI fest.",1
"Nowhere near as bad as what the mentally challenged critics say. I have seen some rotten movies and this one is nowhere near that bad. In my opinion 15% is like you hate a movie. Where is this one is a solid meh 55 percent 60 maybe. It was definitely super predictable. The ending was dumb. But the special effects were good and there were some pretty decent laughs here and there. When the guy said he had the twinkie sweats about laughed milk out my nose. But the story line was somewhat derivative in my opinion. But definitely not 15%, that's like a rating you would give a movie with really terrible acting and the worst direction with really crappy special effects. Like a really crappy '80s B movie. And I got to tell you I've seen these same critics praise movies that are really garbage. So who knows maybe somebody sold them some dirty crack to put in their crack pipes.",3
"Very enjoyable, good CGI, creative. ",5
"A bit of information for the review: The Electric State (2018) is a graphic novel by Simon St√•lenhag, a Swedish author. It is a beautifully drawn story that follows a young girl and a companion robot exploring a sci-fi alternate USA after a collapse when millions fled into a dream world through helmets that left them as decaying corpses on the side of a road. There are more aspects of the world as well, such as the towering robots, the remnants of humanity still living their lives, and the subtle touch of eldritch horror. It is a melancholic, dark, and moody book.

This movie is an action flick, which barely touches on the themes, ideas, and atmosphere of the original work. It is a big disconnect from the setting that St√•lenhag built. This feels less like an adaptation akin to Lord of the Rings and more like the Hobbit movies. It is not as bad as it could‚Äôve been, but certainly not what I would‚Äôve expected.

If this was a standalone film, without a connection to St√•lenhag, it might rate higher. It is certainly not bad, like something like the Borderlands movie was. But as it is? I cannot recommended this as an adaptation. ",2
Its better than the critics reviews of 15% with beautiful imagery and CGI - the robots feel real like they could belong in the world. i think that the full potential was not reached - things like what the helmets actually did to the brain- the stakes could have been much higher but in the end its a popcorn watch with a predictable plot,3
"Seriously, why?? Good special effects. Otherwise, why?",2
"The thing about this movie is that for the most of it I was asleep, but from time to time a waked up and watch a short bit, then felt asleep again and so on until the las part of the movie, which I saw, but I understood everything of it perfectly, so that's not so good... I think.",3

I often don't understand the critics but this one is really out there. 15% from critics and 74% for audience. This is a good story surrounded with excellent special effects and ingenious robot creations. Ignore the critics and check it out!,5
"Another generic film, I didn't think it was bad at all, it's a great film to watch on a Sunday night, but for the price spent it should be a masterpiece.",4
Given all the negativity surrounding the film is didn't go into it with high expectations.. fair to say coming out the other end yes it's not the Greatest film of all time but it's enjoyable in a switch off and just enjoy the escapism kind of way.,4
Enjoyed the movie I was expecting a little more considering the  budget. Wasn‚Äôt a bad movie  would watch again. ,3.5
The first part is kind of creepy and suspenseful.  The second part is sad.  Entertaining watch.  ,3.5
This movie feels like it was written by a child with the help of a Gen X parent. The relentless amount of plot holes are better food for thought than the movie.,1.5

"First of all it's good to see Jason Alexander again, and ke huy quan is an absolute treasure. this movie was boring, lame and forgettable. ",0.5
"It's not just a robot movie; it's a human love movie with many touching parts throughout. Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt carry the flick as its main stars, but Stanley Tucci, as the antagonist, Giancarlo Esposito and Jason Alexander's roles help to give this film more color. Great action movie with enough of a heart-warming human angle, that it gives the movie its touching element. ",5
"Pretty weird how many negative reviews there are.
We all enjoyed it. Fun, different and poignant. ",4
"Not good. Story is very rushed, so much so you really don‚Äôt care about any of the characters. It sort of feels like it was an idea for a series that got reduced to a 1:45 movie. A lot of wasted talent went into this.",1.5
"Since conquering the world with Avengers: Endgame, brothers Joe and Anthony Russo have faced a harsh reality: the difficulty of replicating their success outside Marvel Studios. Their post-Ultimatum projects, Cherry and Hidden Agent, were met with a lukewarm reception, revealing the duo's fragility when removed from a previously established cinematic universe. The Electric State, their latest work, appears as their last chance to demonstrate that they still have the ability to tell good stories in isolation. However, the film not only reaffirms their narrative limitations, but also exposes an excessive reliance on easy formulas: nostalgia, blatant references to other works and a superficial appeal to the public.

Based on the graphic novel by Simon St√•lenhag, The Electric State was supposed to be an immersive work of science fiction, capable of exploring the relationship between humans, artificial intelligence and technology in an apocalyptic world. The genre has already been brilliantly explored by other films, such as The Matrix and Ex Machina, raising philosophical and ethical questions about the impact of technology on society. However, the Russo brothers choose to reduce these themes to simple subplots and turn the robots into comic reliefs, emptying them of any reflective potential. Instead of a thought-provoking approach, the film is content to be a parade of references to the 90s, using pop brands and elements in an excessively obvious way. The attempt to cover up this dependence is non-existent; on the contrary, the directors make a point of making their influences clear, which ends up diluting any trace of originality in the narrative.

Another major problem with The Electric State is the fragility of its character development. The relationship between humans and robots is shallow, without emotion or genuine impact. The protagonists are constructed in a stereotypical way, and the attempt to forge a family drama doesn't find enough narrative foundation to work. The film especially fails to address the emotional arc of its characters, making the journey an apathetic experience. Millie Bobby Brown tries hard to carry the film, moving well between drama and comedy, but the script doesn't offer her solid material. Chris Pratt repeats his performance from Guardians of the Galaxy, without adding any layer to his character. Even more disappointing is the waste of talented actors like Stanley Tucci and Giancarlo Esposito, relegated to irrelevant roles with virtually no screen time.

On the technical side, the movie has moments of brilliance, but also stumbles. The high budget of $320 million makes The Electric State Netflix's most expensive production, but the investment isn't always reflected on screen. Some visual effects sequences are impressive, while others seem rushed, without the necessary polish. This imbalance suggests that, despite the money invested, the film lacked a director capable of balancing the visual resources narratively. Gareth Edwards, with Resistance, and Takashi Yamazaki, with Godzilla Minus One, have shown that budget is not a determining factor for well-executed visual effects, as long as there is efficient planning right from the shoot. The Russo brothers, on the other hand, seem to rely more on grandiosity than visual cohesion.

The question remains: where do the Russo brothers go from here? Their next big project will be none other than Avengers: Doomsday, and concern is growing at their difficulty in delivering an engaging movie without an established foundation. So far, all his projects outside of Marvel have shown creative exhaustion and an inability to tell remarkable stories without resorting to pre-established formulas. It's possible that his next foray into the Avengers will also suffer from these problems, only finding redemption in the eagerly awaited Avengers: Secret Wars.

In the end, The Electric State had everything it needed to be a great movie: a good basis in the graphic novel, a talented cast and a million-dollar budget. However, the directors took the easy way out, filling the film with nostalgia and references instead of exploring its story in depth. The result is a movie that occasionally entertains, but is superficial and forgettable. Netflix has invested in an empty overproduction that is unlikely to make a mark on the science fiction genre.",2

it's a 4 for me. enjoy guys",4

There is a lot of cool stuff in here honestly but you got to turn off  your brain  because you won't be able to enjoy the movie there's a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense but you'll enjoy yourself and have a good time I'm not going to be as hard as everyone else is on this movie cuz there's some great background and scenery and action is pretty decent I think the Russo's did a pretty good job despite the negatives.,3.5
"Some times good, some times bad, MID",2.5
Definately worth watching.  Forget the negative reviews by critics.  The production value is big screen worthy.  I am not saying this is a great film but it is fun.  Watch it!,4
"We cannot watch it with my wife after 30 minutes of trying. Instead of continue movies like OA, 1899, Santa Clara Diet, etc... they invested enormous amount of money into this bullshit.",0.5
"Don't listen to the negative reviews. This film is extremely well done. It was engaging, laugh-out-loud funny, and had some amazing action sequences. MBB and Chris Pratt are excellent. Only the Russo brothers can pull something off at this scale, and it's sad that people can't appreciate just how much went into this.",4
"Enjoyable, watchable, with a good dose of intensity and emotion brought in. I enjoyed the leads (evil, good, and neutral alike), and the effects and personality given to the robots was also fun (and pulled at the heart strings). 

Not sure why the reviewers all hate on this movie, but with older kids, worth a watch. ",4.5
"Ignore the detached critic reviews. There is clearly a divide of what they think and what the real audience thinks in today‚Äôs pop culture. This movie was an absolute five star that hits all the marks in a great story! Full of action, humor and heart! ",5
"The Electric State, One of the worst rated movies on Rotten tomatoes, but does it really deserve that rating, well here's my thoughts 

The worst part of this movie is that, the story and pacing is really bad, you don't even know what your watching, with all the other side plots in the film. But the thing I'm mad is that it won't capture the novel it's based on.

The best part of the movie, is the CGI, it's really impressive and Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt did really good, and there's a fight scene near the end, which was really enjoyable :D

In conclusion, This is one of those book adaptations, where it does not capture the novel at all, but it can bring impressive CGI.

Final rating: 4/10",3.5

"First-ever Rotten Tomatoes review because I loved this movie! Sure, it‚Äôs not an artsy deep flick, but if you‚Äôre into sci-fi with a little camp, this is absolutely for you. The negative critic reviews only made me more curious, and as a huge sci-fi fan, I have to say‚Äîit delivered.

It‚Äôs well-done, worth every minute, and just a crazy, hectic, super fun joyride. When the audience and critics disagree this much, you have to wonder‚Ä¶ why?

Find out for yourself, and enjoy the ride!",5
"This movie started off well, but quickly lost its way with an overuse of robots and a weak script. I honestly couldn't finish it‚Äîit just became exhausting to watch. It's incredible how, despite having all the necessary ingredients for a great sci-fi film, the filmmakers managed to make it so tedious with excessive reliance on robots and a poorly developed storyline. I genuinely believe that if I asked ChatGPT to write a script for this movie, it would have turned out much better. It's a shame that three great actors‚ÄîChris Pratt, Millie Bobby Brown, and Woody Harrelson‚Äîended up in this mess. They deserved better. Skip this one, unless you need some background noise for a nap.

"Liked it, not as bad as some are making out.

Pratt is Pratt, always funny and watchable.

Millie Bobby is decent, I'll watch anything she is in.

It's not the movie of the century but I enjoyed it. A good way to spend a rainy afternoon for sure. ,3.5
"In my opinion, a big screen movie! I really liked it! Well done everyone! Recommended",5
"A new and different perspective for an old and tried theme.  Simply put, this movie is an enjoyable journey for a young woman to save her brother from the corporate overlord who is using the brother to control all society.  The bigger more complicated story is all the surrounding characters and landscape that the journey takes place in.  If you approach this movie with tunnel vision focused on achieving specific goals you'll miss that this is an immersive experience that should probably be viewed multiple times to fully appreciate.
Don't get distracted by the Han Solo like character and dialogue though Millie Bobbie Brown does a much better job countering Chris Pratt's awkward caricature lines.  There are multiple stories in this movie, absorb all of them to truly experience all it has to offer.",4.5
"Love the robots, enjoyed the texture.  Really had a lot of potential, but...No soul.  Drab acting by both, but particularly MBB was exactly the same in every scene.  Chris was simply miscast, needed a much younger actor.  He was kind of sleepwalking throughout.  Directing and editing were mixed, sometimes good and mostly just missed by a beat.  Such wasted potential.",3

You dive into a post-apocalyptic world full of Disney-like robots.

Sure, at times it has the feel of a typical 08/15 Hollywood blockbuster, but I found it very entertaining.

People who don‚Äôt understand the film industry might complain about the budget, but the animations and VFX/CGI effects are so well done that you don‚Äôt even notice them as such. I‚Äôve seen plenty of other film franchises where the effects look extremely bad in comparison.

For me, it‚Äôs a solid 4.5/5.

It was an easy going, fun filled movie, with a great cast. For me this is one of those films you can just throw on and casually watch, a bit like Day After Tomorrow.
I‚Äôll admit Millie Bobby Brown‚Äôs acting was a bit ‚Äúwoody‚Äù, but for the most part she was okay. It had fun elements, drama, and heart.
I‚Äôve never understood why critics pan, it‚Äôs like they want every movie to be a masterpiece; it‚Äôs okay for some films to be ‚Äúmeh‚Äù. Usually it‚Äôs the ‚Äúmeh‚Äù films that are the best, a score of 15% is pretty harsh, and it‚Äôs good to see this film received well by audiences.",3.5
I really enjoyed this film. The bleak background of humanity trying to keep robots down while humans lose their humanity to vr headsets and false lives. The movie talks about connections. The movie hits a lot of emotional beats. The critics must be living in a fantasy land to not enjoy this movie. It's good. Go watch it for yourselves. Critics are out of touch and pointless.,5
"Love the robots. That's about it. Predictable. Forced. One-liner groaners every three seconds. Emotions
Impact is zero. Uses retro rock hits to try and be fun like Gaurdians of the Galaxy but has none of the soul of those films. I get the sneaking suspicion the script was written by AI l, scored by AI and made by a commitee of financial officers working for a Hollywood studio. ",2

"Best AI robot movie since Terminator 2.  Amazing CGI effects, a star-studded voice acting cast, powerful and emotional storytelling, and an incredibly engaging story.  Top notch acting regardless of only like 3 real actors with mostly voice acting with CGI robots.  I could not recommend more.  And more criticism on the critics below:  

So given the poor critic reviews, as well as being a Netflix original I was very skeptical about this movie.  Though the user reviews and specifically one on RT who said the critics don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about (Can‚Äôt remember who you are so I apologize) convinced me to give this movie a chance.  And I am incredibly Glad I did.  I can understand the argument that the movie runs with some degree of predictability but honestly in this day and age what movie does not?  Any critics who Gave this movie A poor reviewI really don‚Äôt understand you.  Not only in this movie, incredibly fun to watch, But it has a very emotional and moving ending.  ",5
"I thinks this is Great movie, but I know the Russo brothers this story was ment to be 2 or 3 movies and they were forced to make it into one movie. The movie was fun it was beautiful, but the story moved far too fast. As someone who has love the art of the original book for years. I am excited to see that such an incredible cast and the Rsso‚Äôs where given this IP. It‚Äôs very disappointing to see that they fast tracked it. There is so much story to tell yet it was broken down into a very small story. This could have been a franchise of beautiful interesting thought provoking stories. Now it has been broken down to one very small far less interesting story:",4
For those that only believe the critics well for this one they are rotten.  This was an unexpectedly fun watch.  And get your tissues for the last 15 minutes.  ,5
Boring and not original.  It takes a lot of ideas from other movies but doesn't land them,0.5
"Sometimes you have to suspend reality to enjoy a great movie. Great work by the Russo's again. It is incredibly hard to make something new and profound and relevant to the present. Even with all the technology all around us we are still human and we should preserve this essence. It's important. Our humanity, the best of our humanity at the least. The technology is in our image. It will co-exist with us. Great message. Watch the movie. Hope you enjoy it as well.",5

THIS MOVIEE MADE ME CRYY,5
"An awesome and original feeling movie, something we haven‚Äôt had in a long time and the the touch of nostalgia was good too. This will definitely be an instant classic in my book and feels like the Russo brother‚Äôs own ‚Äúready player one‚Äù and the difference in score from critics vs audience definitely tells you the critics are out of touch and you should watch this and decide yourself.",5

"Like a Marvel film minus the witty parts, which just leaves one-liners-as-dialogue that are flat and boring. The story is full of holes, they expect the audience to forgive a lot and not ask too many questions. There is absolutely nothing original or creative, lots of cliches and ripped of ideas. They just want the viewer to rely on eye candy and forget that this movie is a complete overpriced waste of time. ",1
"Netflix could have made 10 good $30 million-dollar movies instead of this crap. Or 30 $10 million-dollar movies.  Frustrating.  The script is hollow, the acting soulless.  Feels like Spielberg directed this, with saccharine-sweet false emotions, and a cloying musical score.  Hard pass.",0.5

"The artwork in this film is a great representation of Stalenhag's brilliant work. However aside from that the filmmakers took the brilliant liminal space and intentional focus on humanity with technology as a background theme that is of little importance with regard to understanding ourselves through the lens of of our dreams and their failures, and shattered those beautiful concepts by attempting to force this artists phenomenal contribution into yet another marvel movie.

Not every film needs a CGI battle, not every film needs to over explain the premise, and it is far better to make a film that inspires thought and introspect than just another version of 'good guys wear white'

Three stars as the imagery was authentic, but if you want a cinematic experience of Stalenhag, watch ""Tales From the Loop"" on Prime.

A better critique might be ""By turning Stalenhag's work into a Marvel movie, the filmmakers are ironically proving themselves to be the saddening failure of humanity which Stalenhag is attempting to depict within his works. I worry for the bland and vapid world we are in""",3

Boringish .generic. unimaginitive. The styiling was cool but mostly thats about it. The nuro link was interesting but it's world building is barely  featured and would have been interesting to delve into.the main story line was flat as a pancake.the movie tried to narate itself a lot of the time.

"I agree with many others - I'm not sure what movie the critics are watching, or what agenda they have, but this movie is so much better than the reviews of the so-called experts. It was fun, exciting, heartfelt, thrilling, action-packed, well made and extremely well acted! I thoroughly enjoyed it! My suggestion is for you to watch it for yourself and make up your own mind, because there's something suspicious about the critics and the bad reviews. Not sure what's going on here, but this movie is... good! üëç",5
"Overall the film is a wonderfully faithful adaptation of Simon St√•lenhag visual style, I loved seeing all the artworks he's done though his book incorporated into this film, and all the new additions to the film follow his style and fit in well. However, that's where the praise for this movie ends. The characters and their arc's where extremely contrived and predictable. I predicted multiple times what was going to happen in the movie,  and I've seen 50 iterations of this same basic plot structure before, and had no real connection to the problems of the characters. I would usually let this slide if it was a stand-alone ip or some sequel to a franchise, but Simon St√•lenhag's original book is so incredibly unique in its slow pacing, somber tone, and actual innovative comments on humans addiction to technology, and this movie squanders it. It could have been so much more than a generic action movie with a big bad tech CEO. I'm hesitant to call it corporate slop, as it does have St√•lenhag's visual style and a few redeeming qualities in its first 30 minutes, but it isn't anything too special. ",2
Great movie that was fun to watch. Critics are a bunch of donkeys. Anytime the critics give a universally low rating I know it will be a hit with the rest of the world. Bunch of self congratulating dummies. ,4
"The critics are crazy. At this point I'm just about ready to ignore their ratings and only trust the audience score -- and you should, too. 

The Electric State is a wonderful film. Not perfect, but still wonderful. It's dystopian, but not in a bad way. It's got serious Ready Player One vibes to it. Serious Ender's Game vibes. If you like either of those, you'll love this film. ",4.5
"I really have to wonder if the critics panning The Electric State have kids. I watched it with mine and they loved it. I told them the movie critics don‚Äôt like it, and they asked me why? A good question indeed. This isn‚Äôt the 1 star movie the critics are making it out to be. ",5

"Don't listen to the idiot critics that actually hate their lives and their jobs.   This movie is a must see.  You will either love it so much you watch it 2 or 3 times, or you will hate it.   The movie is fun, has heart, some great messaging and beautiful effects.      Go into it with an open mind and just watch it for fun!",5
"Look, is this movie going to go in your top 10 of all time? No. Was the acting worthy of an academy award? Definitely not. Will this movie be enough to keep you mindlessly entertained with action and quirky jokes and just a smidge of heartfelt drama? Yes. 

The hate on this movie is entirely not justified. Stanley Tucci is always worth a watch in my opinion, and even though he carries the acting chops, the rest of the cast fulfilled their purpose. 

The Russo brothers made a movie that‚Äôs only real job is to be a movie. We don‚Äôt need every drama that comes out to be a statement for civil rights or be too obscure and artsy that no one can follow along. Sometimes all you need is some scruffy looking comic relief, a cute robot and explosions.

Grab your families and some junk food and spend some time together and watch a ‚Äúfun‚Äù movie again. It‚Äôs worth it.

Why would you use AI to make a movie. That is even more disappointing. If i could give it a zero i would cus AI doesn't have any sort of artwork in it. ,0.5
"This movie was absolutely amazing! We watched it twice! I loved the story, the CGI and everything. I do not understand why the big movie critics gave this movie horrible reviews. It just goes to show you that they don‚Äôt know squat about good movies. If your on the fence about watching please do, I promise it won‚Äôt disappoint!",5
"Critics can be way too harsh when reviewing movies, and this one is no exception. No, it‚Äôs not the greatest film ever made, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be. It‚Äôs a solid family movie‚Äîperfect for a cozy night in. There‚Äôs action, there‚Äôs drama, and most importantly, there‚Äôs a whole lot of heart. Sometimes, a movie is just meant to be enjoyed, not overanalyzed. Critics should keep that in mind, but expecting them to lighten up might be asking too much.",5

"Los efectos especiales est√°n bastante bien, pero la pel√≠cula tiene un guion mal√≠simo, nada relevante, no hay trascendencia real en la historia, los personajes son muy mal elaborados y fingidos, el dise√±o de los robots no tiene sentido alguno, luce demasiado extra√±o.",2
"Another film to prove once again that most film critics don't know squat about entertainment.

This might not be the Michelin star meal the critics are looking for, but sometimes you can't beat a good burger and fries ",4
"It was a fun, engaging, heart warming movie with an interesting storyline.  I‚Äôm not sure what the critics watched but it wasn‚Äôt this. ",5
"Watched with my 10 year old, we were both glued to the screen the whole time. Amazing movie, hope there‚Äôs more!",5
A whimsical and fun adventure with plenty of heartwarming moments along with action and humor. My family really enjoyed it!,5
Filme bom e que infelizmente est√° sendo perseguido pela m√≠dia sem o menor motivo ou l√≥gica.,4
"As a new fan of Simon Stalenhag's art, I was excited to see Electric State.  I was hoping to get another Tales From The Loop.  Electric State is visually pleasing with lots of good effects, but that's about it.  Millie Bobbie Brown, whom I forgive, for she is a young actress, failed to stir my emotions, even during the climax with her brother.  Chris Pratt is playing himself, which is fine, but he doesn't get a gold star for going to bathroom.  This is a road trip movie that turns out to be for kids, and as far as I can tell, the filmmakers are hoping the colorful characters will make up for weak storytelling.  ",3
That Was a Good Family Movie,5
"Dont listen to out of touch critics.  The Electric State is visually appealing, has great action and has a very interesting story.  Some moments are absolutely hilarious and had me laughing out loud, and other moments are very touching and heartfelt.  Overall great story and characters, both human and robots.",5
Fun and exciting  movie me and my family loved it! ,5
"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The people that made all the robot designs are real artists. The acting is OK. Must be hard to do in such a CGI environment, but they made all the weird interactions believable. The story is very simpel, but the mobie is filled with silly robot designs so a TENET level plot would have been jarring.",4
"It's ok. I don't understand why so much hate. Relax, it's just a blockbuster movie with outstanding visuals. Get your popcorn and enjoy.",3
"one of the worst movies ever seen.  the whole plot is beyond stupid with bits and pieces of ideas pinched from other movies.
don't even waste your time watching for free.",0.5
Yeah this is another one to not listen to the critics on. It was a fun movie with a lot of heart and the robots were very cool and fun to watch!!,4
This was a really good movie! The Russo brothers always make fantastic movies!,5
"The movie is more of a 3.5 - 4 star review, but with the terrible critic reviews I bumped it up some as they are out of touch. I watched the movie, enjoyed it and would watch it again. 

Not a groundbreaking plot, or groundbreaking action, but a decent story with great effects that keeps you engaged. 

For a Netflix movie, it's a good watch, I definitely recommend. ",5
"BUENA!... no vale los 300 y tantos melones de USD que se gastaron en hacerla (yo dir√≠a unos USD $120M)... pero est√° buena la muvi (los hermanos Russo NUNCA decepcionan)... 100% de streaming (no para movie theaters)... buena l√≠nea alterna de la realidad, respetando los aspectos de los 90's (best decade E.V.E.R)... buen mensaje (desconectarnos un poco de los aparatos, conectarnos m√°s como humanos)... MUY buenos efectos (herencia de District 9 y Chappie)... buen pace, divertida, entretenida... deben verla",4
"The Electric State proves once again why the Russo‚Äôs are some of the best blockbuster directors currently in Hollywood. Big hearted, witty dialogue, great cast, technology-pushing FX work; it‚Äôs all here and done well!",4
"I can understand why some people have rated this movie low, it's a big cgi blockbuster movie that strays from the source material. But despite knowing that before I watched it, I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The design and the environments are great and really harken back to the source material. The actors all did a great job and were funny. The script was a weaker point of the movie, but not altogether bad. Overall, I really liked this movie and it definitely doesn't deserve it's low rating. Give new movies a chance people!",4.5
Another good one from Anthony and Joe Russo,4
"I loved this movie, as did my two kids. 

The film brings ethical issues such as; Is it intended that robots that have their own consciousness can be treated equally with humans? Should we want the future with robots and AI to take over everything from humans to make life ""easier""? Do we want a on-going digital progress in which we, as humans, emotionally speaking, are increasingly get to stand further from each other? 

And then there's the feeling of love between a sister and brother, a friend and his robot. They all go through hell for each other. Show you that life is to live with, and for, each other. 

This movie brings all kinds of robots with a cool style. A bit cartoon-like, which reminds me of American stuff from the 50s onwards. 

There is plenty of action and tension and occasionally room for emotions such as sadness and humor. The film looks great too.

The actors are nice to watch and come across as credible. 

This movie gets a ten from me.  ",5
"Best film of 2025 so far.
The quality of films recently have been poor in general.
This film is funny. 
The Robots are great. 
Good story. 
Chris Prat is great as always.
Special effects are stunning.
This is a must watch. ",5
"Chis Pratt is always great, movie is ok, great  CGI, the movie had no soul, and to much back story at the start. By the end I did not care about the brother and sister  .  8/10",4
not sure why all the hate but if critics give it a bad review then it is worth watching. I thought it was a good fun movie with cool robots. MBB and Pratt are great in their roles. good family film,4
"I see that a lot of people left bad reviews. I'm not sure why, because this is a really good movie! Its not some kind of ""masterpiece"" lol. But its good for sure. It has plenty of action, comedy, connection to the characters, awesome imagery, and great imagination. It's a movie for all ages. ",5
"The Electric State is actually a very good concept, but its execution is incredibly rushed.

The cast is amazing and the visuals are fantastic, the CGI robots were well made, it had a good message (people need to stop dissociating themselves from reality and get addicted to technology, relationships are important - but it could have been nice to explore the realities of this world a little more).",3
"This is a great movie to watch with your kids! I actually watched it first, really enjoyed it (Chris Pratt & MBB are two faves), and then watched it again with my son who loved it. It has robots, action, humor, heart. I don't understand why the critical reviews are so bad to be honest. Pop some popcorn and have a family movie night! üçø",5
Bland and uninspiring with a story thinner than toilet paper in a public toilet. ,0.5
"Boring, predictable. A budget of over 300 million dollars for this? Unbelievable.",2
Waste of money and time,1
"The visual are next level, the cast and cameos are beyond anything I was expecting and the story is something between pixar and Matrix, meaning it is  emotional and borderline based on a potential, plausible future.",5
"It's visually spectacular, with a fast-paced, fun story.  Has a 80's or 90's Spielberg vibe, we need more movies like this that can be watched by everyone, from Grandparents to Grandkids.  I seriously do not understand the hate on this movie, unless you argue they deviate from the comic too much.  ",5
"No forced narrative from the usual suspects. (D&L)

Chris Pratt, Millie Brown.

Good enough for me!!",5
"Cr√≠tica: The Electric State √© uma decep√ß√£o colossal. A trama n√£o faz sentido, os di√°logos s√£o fracos e as tentativas de humor falham miseravelmente. O elenco, apesar do talento, n√£o convence, e o resultado √© um desperd√≠cio de potencial. Inacredit√°vel que a Netflix tenha investido US$ 320 milh√µes nisso. Os efeitos visuais s√£o competentes, mas n√£o salvam o filme. A plataforma j√° nos entregou produ√ß√µes incr√≠veis, mas desta vez errou feio. Espero que seja apenas um trope√ßo e que volte a nos surpreender positivamente no futuro.

"Esta pel√≠cula es muy buena, me divert√≠ mucho y es bastante agradable ver el lado de los robots buscando ganarse sus derechos de forma pacifica, como cualquier poblaci√≥n humana lo ha hecho a trav√©s de la historia. Los cr√≠ticos dicen que es p√©sima, pero, estas personas ya no deber√≠an tener importancia. ",5
"The artist that created the sci-fi environment is amazing. It‚Äôs almost as if the directors wanted to just create a movie around the art and the design. But there is no substance. The actors are good actors, but it seems like they didn‚Äôt know what they were doing in the film. There were no surprises, it was long and doll. The only thing cool about it was the futuristic vision. They could‚Äôve done so much more with just a little creativity and imagination. ",1.5
Watchable and forgettable. Impressive sfx and cool robot designs. Run of the mill storyline with no heart.,2.5
"I really enjoyed it. It seems familiar, yet new. I don't feel many reviews are fair - but just my opinion.",4
Ignore the critics. They don‚Äôt like Chris Pratt,4
Como expectador eu amei o filme . Esse filme me lembra o tempo que ficava em frente a TV. Tempos bons! ,5
"I went into this movie with an open mind. I had seen the reviews, but I wanted to give it a fair chance and see it for myself. The movie isn‚Äôt unwatchable, but it is extremely boring. Very little world-building happens and the characters and plot are paper-thin. 

This movie reportedly cost an estimated $320 million to make, and I see no reason why it needed that budget. Most of the scenes are between Millie Bobby Brown‚Äôs and Chris Pratt‚Äôs characters, with an occasional robot near them. Only during the climax does the budget really come into play. And to be super honest, the robots only look okay. I wasn‚Äôt blown away by any of the CGI or robot designs. 

Barely anything happens in this movie and the stakes are so low too. The main characters move from plot point to plot point without any real conflict or opposition.

I guess for a Netflix streaming movie, it‚Äôs something you can put on and look at your phone while it plays. It‚Äôs completely inoffensive and has nothing to say.",1.5
"In the current environment of streaming movies that focus on sugar-high amp'd up action with massive body counts, it's hard to settle into the Electric State and pull out the deep and disturbing trends and social realities it portraits... most of the down-ratings are probably because it didn't splatter enough blood... watch this movie again, and PAY ATTENTION!",4
"as always the trailer was better than the movie. the movie is for ages 12 and up to 14. wasting $320 million. I would like to add that Netflix, as always, loves to ruin everything. It looks like the movie was made only to sell the franchise later",2
Yet again the critics are really wrong on this one I thought it was entertaining.  certainly better than the new captain America movie. It's not perfect but definitely worth a watch.,4.5
"Feels like atomic heart type art, its a good story with deep meaning. Great artistic work, awesome soundtrack. Don't base watching anything off rotten tomatoe reviews. These ""critics"" have had their heads up their you know what for so long their reviews for the past decade are disconnected from reality. Usually rate anything thats worth a watch bad. Definitely worth watching at least once, don't let these babies in their basement tell ya otherwise.",4
The CGI looked great but the plot was lacking and the writing was sub-par.,3
" This had a lot of problems with consistent tone, moving from adult appeal to pure childish writing. The dialog was was atrocious and delivered terribly by 2 normally competitive stars. Visually, it is attractive and fun, but that isn't enough to sustain you for the entire journey. I had very high hopes for this, and it was nothing but a disappointment.",2
This movie is disrespectful to movie enthusiasts. Cool VFX but the writing is absolutely pitiful. Very vanilla villain just trying to cope from having an abusive drunk mommy.,0.5
I tought it was pretty good the story had some holes but if this movie came out a few years ago I would have loved this movie I think it‚Äôs worth a watch ,3.5
"Not great, not bad either. ",2.5
"Big suprise, audience score is a bunch of bots that the only review is this movie. Sadly happens all too often on this site now. The movie was terrible despite it's loaded cast. Save yourself the trouble on this one.",1.5
"It's painful to see so much artistic brilliance, creativity and craftsmanship wasted on such a dumb story. The script is so hectic, it's impossible to remember the big plot points even as you're watching it. And the story has absolutely nothing to do with the elegant and soulful source material.",1
"I dont understand why this movie is getting so much hate. It's a solid movie. Is it great? No. Would I watch a sequel? Absolutely! 

Good effects, decent story and the perfect film for a Sunday afternoon when you just wanna cabbage in the sofa and avoid the outside world. ",3.5
"I don't get the critics' hate. No, this is not a great movie but it was entertaining. The CGI robots were great. It felt a bit like Futurama brought to live action. I don't understand how Avengers movies are getting 90%+ by these same critics. It's not thought provoking cinema but it was just as good or better than any Transformers movie.",3.5
"This film is more like a dull acted children‚Äôs film. I feel sorry for Millie Bobby Brown in this because she‚Äôs given no options to escape the spoon fed simple story verbal. The robot characters are very weak, there‚Äôs no magic like what Robin Williams had done playing a robot. The most interesting element in the film is thrown away as an early monologue. What your left with is a heartless search that seems ripped off from other famous films. I can‚Äôt see the so called massive $320M USD unless there‚Äôs some very clever accounting going on. Maybe this film suffered from too many executive producers, too many VFX vendors, a heavy reliance on motion capture and volume stages. But the obvious biggest disappointment is the dull acting and chemistry of the main characters. Netflix will need to spin a huge negative advertising campaign to get this film eyeballs. I dare say the bloated mega budget connected to a very weak film is akin to inviting the audience to witness a huge train wreck. How can anyone ever resist. I bet most people don‚Äôt last to the second act of this film because the first act totally fails to set up any reason to keep watching. ",1
"This is a fun and great looking film with an intriguing premise. It's semi campy but so well done, it warrants real consideration. The performances are top notch for the on-screen as well as the character performances. I loved the energy. There are a few slow moments, but overall the pacing is spot on. Hardly a dull moment. ",4
"Entertaining with some good effects and an interesting concept, not sure what all the ‚Äúcritics‚Äù are watching",4
"The characters suck. The plot sucks. The pacing sucks. It‚Äôs uninteresting. It‚Äôs boring. It‚Äôs painfully unfunny. The movie sucks and it‚Äôs just not good. If I were forced at gunpoint to say anything nice about it, I‚Äôd say that the robots look really good & Millie Bobby Brown is great as usual. The problem with it is that it‚Äôs just so‚Ä¶ nothing? You don‚Äôt feel ANYTHING while you‚Äôre watching the electric state. No emotion. You feel nothingness. You feel empty inside. The joyous moments don‚Äôt make you feel happy, and the sad moments don‚Äôt make you feel sad. For Christ‚Äôs sake, every time there was a sad moment I ROLLED MY EYES and wished for some cool robot sequences to happen instead‚Ä¶. and I sound like a 10 year old boy with that statement because it‚Äôs just that bad üò≠ skip this one lol, it‚Äôs not worth your time. My rotten tomatoes score: 25/100 üçÖ",1.5
"Good film, 2 h fun, enternatning ",4.5
"It‚Äôs a little slow and tries to do a little too much. But it was funny, had a good concept and the special effects were great. It had a great cast that did their best, some of the hate is over the top. I will definitely watch again. ",3.5
"Very good movie in what it proposes, light, interesting, comfortable, manages to hold you.. it has great effects and captivating characters, many clich√©s, it's no big deal, but it's not bad, not how the critics are falling on top, but what to say also about the critics who gave 75% approval to Emilia P√©rez, right? For me, it lost credibility there, LOL.. I think it's a very big budget for what was presented, but I didn't pay, right? Anyway, it's worth spending time watching something simple and comfortable yes, not everything needs to be head and cult..",4.5
"Weird movie. Also, the sibling relationship in the movie was super weird and forced.",2.5
This may not be the best action movie with robots you would have seen.  This definitely feels predictable.  This movie feels it needs a better plot.  But it would definitely make you feel good.  Chris definitely brings certain scenes alive and I would say the critics are a bit harsher here.,4
"Bad movie, actors did this one for the paychecks not the content or story line. Big let down",1
I truly don‚Äôt understand the hate for this film. It‚Äôs a fun ride. The effects are amazing. It‚Äôs completely worth your two hours.,5
"Considering how hard it is to find anything to watch these days, some of the reviews are overly harsh.  It was pleasant and mildly entertaining.  I would watch it again.  Decent family movie.",3.5
"I honestly don‚Äôt understand the hate surrounding The Electric State‚ÄîI think it‚Äôs a fantastic film. From the very beginning, the storyline hooks you, weaving an emotionally resonant narrative that taps into classic science fiction while feeling refreshingly unique at the same time. Sure, it‚Äôs a bit of a family movie with a focus on love above all else, but it does that beautifully, without being overly sentimental or forced. The writing is solid, and I genuinely appreciate how it strikes the balance between the heartwarming moments and the thrilling, action-packed sequences that propel the plot forward.

The film‚Äôs world-building is one of its strongest suits. It‚Äôs a richly textured, visually stunning future that feels real and immersive, thanks to some incredible CGI. The technology, environments, and even the characters look lifelike, creating a cyberpunk-inspired universe that feels grounded in the real world despite its sci-fi premise. The attention to detail is superb, making you feel like you‚Äôre stepping into a dystopian future that‚Äôs both fascinating and haunting.

The classic ‚Äúbad guy vs. good guy‚Äù dynamic is present, but it‚Äôs handled with depth, giving the story more layers than what you might expect from a typical family film. The conflict doesn‚Äôt just feel like it‚Äôs about saving the world‚Äîit‚Äôs about the relationships and bonds that define us as humans, especially when things seem to be falling apart around us. The film explores themes of survival, connection, and hope, all while presenting a world on the brink of technological collapse. It‚Äôs definitely a bit of a cautionary tale about where we‚Äôre headed if we aren‚Äôt careful, but it never loses sight of the emotional core that makes it so engaging.

Yes, it‚Äôs a family film at its heart, but it‚Äôs a sophisticated one. It doesn‚Äôt talk down to its audience, nor does it shy away from the darker, grittier elements of the sci-fi genre. The pacing is spot-on, and the stakes feel real, even in a futuristic setting. There‚Äôs a good amount of action, but it never overtakes the narrative‚Äîeverything moves in service of the story, and the quieter moments where the family connections are tested are just as powerful as the intense action sequences.

While the performances from Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt may not be the absolute standout, career-defining roles we might expect from such big names, it honestly doesn‚Äôt take away from the film‚Äôs overall impact. Their acting is solid but not the focal point of the movie‚Äîand frankly, that‚Äôs okay. This isn‚Äôt a film that hinges on mind-blowing performances or incredibly complex character arcs. It‚Äôs not trying to be an Oscar contender‚Äîit‚Äôs a story about love, survival, and connection in a stunning, futuristic world, and that‚Äôs exactly what it delivers.

Millie does a decent job portraying the young protagonist, navigating a harsh world with a quiet determination. She doesn‚Äôt need to do more than that‚Äîher role is one of emotional restraint, where her actions speak louder than words. It‚Äôs subtle, but effective. Chris Pratt, on the other hand, brings his usual charm, but his character doesn‚Äôt demand the kind of range that would make or break the film. He plays a supporting role that complements the larger narrative rather than taking the spotlight.

And honestly, that‚Äôs what works here. The film isn‚Äôt trying to force heavy emotional performances out of its cast. Instead, it focuses on world-building, thematic depth, and the dynamic between its characters, which feel far more important than any one actor‚Äôs performance. The moments where the characters truly shine are less about their acting and more about how their stories and relationships unfold within the larger sci-fi context. In this case, it‚Äôs the world and the themes that steal the show, and the performances do just enough to keep you invested without distracting from the heart of the story.

At the end of the day, The Electric State is about the experience‚Äîabout being swept up in this visually captivating world and feeling the emotional beats that come with it. The acting isn‚Äôt groundbreaking, but it doesn‚Äôt need to be. It‚Äôs a family-oriented sci-fi film, and it gets the job done without ever pretending to be anything else.",4
"Felt a bit rushed in parts, but overall good movie.",4.5
"With all that money you could have made 300 great indie films, changing the world and many artists lives, instead you have this. ",1
"In my opinion I loved the movie because it tells a story or a fact that I have thought or dreamed about for a long time, a movie that combines technology, the invention of AI, how the system evolves and how the human mind itself can be capable of creating a unique system which takes us to the desired aptic reality where we can be and do what we want knowing that we put aside our lives, jobs and daily activities just to seek our own happiness and where the same machines that we created to make our lives easier seek only to be accepted as equals and they support us following their programming doing the simple tasks that we imposed on them. I liked it because it is finally a joint work with machines where the fault is really of humans, and where by working together or as a team we seek to solve or fight for freedom, and to make a better world together without destroying each other regardless of what we are made of.  I admit that I cried because of making the decision to sacrifice your own family, your brother... seeing him suffer without being able to help him is a very hard thought, losing those you love and who remain as family.",5
"Entertaining and unique. Not the greatest, but definitely not the worst. A movie that gets the job done. ",4
"This movie is fun, it might not have the best story out there but the visuals are amazing, the robots definitely carry the movie and I wish there was more of them. this movie is over hated and it‚Äôs sad to see because it‚Äôs good, I WANT MORE!!",4
"""The visual graphic is excellent! It wisely advises us to connect with friends in person, rather than getting lost in the virtual world of modern electronic devices.""",5
It's worth a watch. Sure it's a silly alternate universe but not so bad as all these critics seem to want to bash it.,4
Stuff like this makes me want to cancel TV.,1.5
"There is nothing special here. The story is so so as is the writing. That doesn't mean you won't get a chuckle every now and then or enjoy some of the characters (mainly the robots). 

It's average at best but if you're looking for some not so deep entertainment with few laughs, this movie will suffice. ",3
"I love Simon St√•lenhag if you do too, check out his books. I had low expectations because of the Tales From The Loop TV show but these expectations were surpassed. It's not a good adaptation but it is a good movie. My only complaint would be there wasn't enough focus on the main protagonist so the ending with her brother felt rushed and out of nowhere but hey, I never made a movie.",4.5
"Great movie!!!
I really don‚Äôt understand all the bad reviews it gets. It‚Äôs definitely one of the best out there. Plus, it has stunning visuals and world-building.",5
"decent enough movie, definitely better then the reviews the ""critics"" are giving it",4
"Yeah it's awful. But it makes me wonder what simon st√•lenhag thought of it... it's nothing like his book. The book is amazing. You didn't need to take an existing work and make it the opposite of what the book intended. Even if it was an original movie, it would still be mid at best.",1
"While the one liners come off as odd pun jokes now and again, this is a win for Netflix. Superb visual effects and a message that the world - especially those living in the US right now - need to hear. Put down the phones and connect with another person. Maybe there would be less of a divide if we actually spoke in person, where we see our words and actions have meaning and consequence. Not a perfect delivery, but it lands.",4
"Great special effects, fantastic/epic world-building and some fun action. Ultimately, there was a *lot* of clich√© dialogue and elements to the story. Some of the premise was incredibly dumb and impractical (I guess it's based on a comic book? I'm unfamiliar with that). Anyway, kids and young teens will probably enjoy this more than adults, while adults will understand all of the 90's references that will go over kids' heads. Ultimately, it was fun, but not as epic as it probably could have (and should have) been.",3.5
This movie was very entertaining and action packed. I liked it and think it's worth a watch. ,3.5

"I loved it‚Ä¶ and the ending seeing the reflection of the cartoon robot‚Ä¶ maybe another movie. All this neg talk - due to the world now needs cussing , kissing, blood‚Ä¶. This was a ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù movie. And absolutely not boring or slow. It‚Äôs a family friendly movie. Watch it, and ignore these negative comments! ",5
"An absolutely amazing movie, it was so great to watch! Honestly the critics were 95% wrong about this, the acting was good, although the writing for dialogue could have been better for a 300 something million dollar movie, I wouldn't notice or care about it at all if I wasn't analyzing the character's dialogue.

The scenery and cgi was insanely good, and it stuck to Simon St√•lenhag's book pretty well honestly. I recognized tons of robots and scenes that are exactly what was shown in the book, and although people were mad about the trailers and how the movie differed from the book, it doesn't matter what critics think about book vs movie if Simon himself approved and supported of the movie, and the movie can't be a 1 to 1 exact copy of the book or else it wouldn't appeal to the vast majority of teens and the younger generations like St√•lenhag wanted, it would appeal to a bunch of crusty older movie critics. 

Sure, you can tell the Russo brothers Marvel background leaked into the movie a bit with the bruuuuuummmm epic music, but it was fine. What do you expect if they are directing the whole thing?

10/10 will recommend and watch again",5
"I get it, this is one of those family movies from the 70s and 80s. It's not deep or well written; but it's fun.

The robots are great, there is loads of action and the visuals are great. It's just enjoyable nonsense. I would like to see a director's cut though, as the plot has some holes and some characters haven't much depth.

Great older family movie, the language might be a bit much for wee ones.",4
"As a fan of the author and his books I was looking forward to this movie. I was surprised that it wasn't labeled ""Loosely based""! Regardless, if there was no assocation to the book, this would be a good 3.5 star movie based on the cast and the action. ",3.5
"For a movie released on streaming, it's pretty good. It's goofy, but as a way to get your brain off on a Saturday night, it's good enough. I only didn't like the ending because it didn't make much sense, but that's just my opinion.",3.5
"Original, funny, absurd, with great visuals - I really don't get what people didn't like about it. There is a lot of Guardians of Galaxy style here with Chris Pratt and robot world reminds me of fallout series. Love it. Definitely worth watching, don't listen to paid critics.

p.s. It's light hearted and family friendly so definitely skip if you look for something hardcore.",5
"Really good! Excellent story, visual effects, character development, etc. I recognize that the movie's target audience is a bit younger, so I didn‚Äôt love absolutely everything, but I enjoyed it a lot!",4

"Electric State is an interesting movie.  Not a blockbuster for actors, but once you actually start paying attention you actually start enjoying it.  The tech portion of the movie is a little non-techy, more of just a consumer level of tech.  If you are looking for a level of science, this is not the movie for you.  If you want to be entertained and turn off the brain, it is not bad.  It starts out a little confusing to follow but stick with it.  Chris Pratt does a great job as part obnoxious, part thief, and part hero.

Even after the scathing reviews, this is just pure entertainment.  ",4
"A visual delight. The script needed a bit more work, as some of the best characters were robots, which is an achievement. MBB was good in her role. Others? Meh. Your kids will love it.",3.5
"There are some interesting ideas and themes here that could have led to a much better movie.  As it stands, it's basically fine, but a bit of a let down.

Pros: The CGI looks really good. Also, some of the robots are quite cute and easy to root for. 

Cons: The premise, setup and world is a bit of a mess, and doesn't hold up to even light scrutiny. 

Millie Bobby Brown was bad and Chris Pratt is basically just doing Starlord.

I know it's more of a kids/teeny movie, but the script and story feels very cliche and on the nose. But this is starting to feel like a feature, and not a bug, of streaming movies. Everything gets watered down and spoon fed because they don't trust that their audience is fully engaged and paying attention.",2.5
"We enjoyed it! it was a little slow at times but overall kept moving along quickly enough to keep our attention. Visually, it was a dream! It felt like a Pixar movie come to life, but so well done that nothing ""looked"" like CGI. Being an alternate reality sort of plot, I really appreciate that it kept things fairly simple and didn't get bogged down with too many details. Just enough history so that you understand the circumstances but not so detailed that it distracted from the story being told in the movie. I loved all of the characters, and would be more than happy to see a sequel, or prequel, or both!",4.5
"This movie is a classic example of what movie critics don't get when reviewing movies like this. It's a movie that's meant for a bit of Saturday night entertainment and that's what it delivers. The story isn't meant to be taken seriously, it's just a bit of fun. ",4.5
"Not brilliant but not bad. I can only assume the professional critics watched a different movie. Perfectly watchable, my wife and I a perfectly good way to spend a couple of hours.",4
"I thought the visuals were great, but unfortunately the story and acting were poor.  Chris Pratt was really bad sure seemed like just a payday for him.   A real shame because the robots were very interesting and well done. ",2
This was a good movie.. if we would quit trying to politicalize everything and just sit back and watch we'd enjoy everything so much more... with good friends and family you could have a pizza night.  Could it be classified as a kids movie.. ok maybe it could for older kids.  So keep that in mind when watching this.. and the forever bond of siblings and the evil people trying to destoy it. ,5
"The Electric State is a visually stunning dystopian sci-fi film with a compelling story. The cinematography and special effects are engaging and believable, creating an immersive and atmospheric world. The acting is strong, with well-developed character arcs that add emotional depth to the narrative. Overall, it's a fantastic blend of storytelling and visuals that makes for a memorable experience.",4.5
It seems ‚Äúprofessional film critics‚Äù are missing what audiences love again. Everyone I know has adored this film. ,5
Had a great time fun for all,5
What a waste of money and good actors. The script is awful; everything very predictable. Tales from the Loop is a lot more interesting.,0.5
"This was one of the better family movies to come out in a long while. No massive campaign trying to shame you into watching. No political agendas. No manufactured drama. Just fun light story telling. A movie that was just a movie, which makes it fairly unique in a pretentious agenda centric industry. 

All it had to do to be one of the best family movies in many years, was simply be a movie. I love how critics are attempting to review bomb it for focusing on being fun entertainment, shows exactly how our of touch they are with what people want from the entertainment industry. We want to be entertained, at least this is what I want and expect if they expect my money. ",4
"MEIN TOASTER IDENTIFIZIERT SICH ALS K√úHLSCHRANK?

In den 90ern brach ein Krieg gegen die Maschinen aus, weil Bots keine Lust mehr hatten zu arbeiten und da die Menschen keine Aufst√§nde m√∂gen wurde jeder Bot eliminiert. Menschen k√∂nnen Jahre sp√§ter selbst als Maschinen rumlaufen, jedoch hat die Teenagerin Michelle darauf null Bock, dies merkt man an ihrer edgy Einstellung und den dicken Kajal. Als jedoch ihr tot geglaubter Bruder als Bot vor ihr steht, wird es Zeit die Welt noch einmal zu ver√§ndern.

The Electric State geht ca. 128 Minuten und ist auf Netflix verf√ºgbar. Wir haben hier Milly Bobby Brown und Chris Pratt in den Hauptrollen dieses 320 Millionen Doller teuren Sci-Fi Streifens.
Ein wenig Terminator hier, ein wenig I Robot da sowie eine Priese Surrogates und schon haben wir eine neue Geschichte die sich alt und bekannt anf√ºhlt.
Das gute vorweg, Chris Pratt und sein Buddy machen Spa√ü, es gibt den Standard Klamauk mit Spr√ºchen und Slapstick.
Der Rest ist leider Quatsch, angefangen bei der Story in der Maschinen mehr f√ºr sich wollen als nur ihre Programmierung zu verrichten, woher das kommt, keine Ahnung. Wieso es √ºberall VR Brillen und sprechende KI Bots gibt, aber das Interface eines Computers nach Windows 95 aussieht, keine Ahnung. Dazu gesellt sich eine Milly Bobby Brown die soviel Charme verspr√ºht wie eine Tasse lauwarmes Wasser. Sie kann zu dem kaum Auto fahren, aber nen Bagger ist kein Problem.
Das Finale wirft die Frage auf wie es der Menschheit gelang den Krieg zu gewinnen, wenn sie es nicht mal schaffen nen Haufen Schrott um zu nieten. Obendrein soll man noch Gef√ºhle f√ºr die kaputten Bots haben wenn der Vorhang f√§llt, ja nee komm, Deckel drauf und gut ist.
Am Ende bleibt ein Werk das mit besserer Story und Drehbuch durchaus ernstzunehmen gewesen w√§re. So aber bleibt ein unterdurchschnittlicher, spannungsarmer und dr√∂ger Streifen.

Von mir bekommt der Film 4,5/10 Punkten. Die Welt hasst Maschinen, zumindest die mit ""eigenen Willen"". Bei einer Kaffeemaschine w√ºrde man aber sicher ne Ausnahme machen.",2
"The film has average quality; the visual effects are satisfactory, but the script is deficient and the pace slow, as are the performances.",2
"The kids loved it. Robots, fighting, more Robots. My kids are 13 and 10, both sat through the movie without looking at tablets or phones, a near miracle. OK it's not an Oscar winner and my eldest said that Bobby was 'too old' to play Michelle...but fun.",4
"Netflix, you were on the verge of something big, but then you chose the ""safe"" route. Every time I thought the characters were finally getting some soul, you stopped. It's a shame, because the visuals are really good, but unfortunately, the film lacks any narrative substance.",1.5
"I really hope these so called ‚Äúmovie critics‚Äù aren‚Äôt getting paid to post on here because yet again they prove they are massively out of touch and/or are more concerned about creating a witty one liner like they are Oscar Wilde than giving a honest review.

",5
Not nearly as bad as the reviewers say. Very high production values and a bit of a Goonies/E.T-ish adventure (although pitched older than both). A bit predictable but worth a watch,4
I thought it was great. it one of the few good family movies I can watch with my young children. They could have toned down the cursing but we were able to censor that but overall the kids loved it and we enjoyed it.,4.5
Well the critic got this wrong it is never a 14% movie it deserves 15%. And thats for the CGI - another destruction of the source material similar to Ready player one. The Cameos seem to be just an excuse to pay their friends a lot of money for less than a days work.,1.5
"Not in anyway in the tone of the original concept (watch Tales from the Loop for that), but non the less it was loads of fun and beautiful to look at.",5
"there are so few movies now that I can sit and enjoy with my kids, it dragged my son out of his room for an evening and kept us entertained! perfect popcorn movie well acted and some amazing visuals ! ",5
"I don't get why the movie has gotten so much hate. For me I absolutely loved every second of it. Gave me very 2000's /2010's movies vibes that I had been missing for years and the entire movie was a thrill. Good pacing, good story, good visuals and great castings. It feels like some reviews just want to nick pick every detail instead of seeing. what this movie could actually be. A fun family evening movie with friends/family and good food! Loved it! ",5
"Was nice,dont read the Critics all payed to rate it down,Rottentomatos is not known to be seri√∂s to be rating movies is the worst",5
"Definitely ignore the critics on this one. Was fun, heartfelt and has a great soundtrack. Enjoy!",4
"It was like ""Star Wars"" meets ""Spongebob""!
I loved it but remember, I also liked Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies and Gilligan's Island. So take it with a grain of salt. Let's just say, ""I found it entertaining"". The special effects were quite good as well, in their own silly way!",4.5
Don‚Äôt listen to the hate. If you think you will like this movie then watch it and you will not be disappointed. ,4
"Fantastic CGI, bad character development.",3
"Not great but nowhere near as bad as the reviews make out. Stella cast and beautifully rendered cgi. It's just a little... meh? 
Would probably have been better received if it was released over x-mas or even if it had been a full on animated pixar movie. ",3
I thought it was a really fun movie. Good cast with interesting source material.,5
"I absolutely love this movie My kids loved it Very cute reminded me of the Goonies 
I went back after watching this great movie and is reading the book
Don't understand why this movie is getting so much slack online It's a beautiful story ",5
Enjoyed the movie despite all the hate around it. Good performance from the actors. Loved the story too. Great special effects too. ,4.5
"Might be going crazy but i actually really enjoyed this flick! Wish the beginning ‚Äúwar‚Äù was longer? but all in all awesome movie, critics suck watch it for yourself!",5
"Absolutely nothing like the art driven story it was based off of. Other than some of the visuals, they took a dark and depressive visual masterpiece about making the most of loss and importance of what you have in a world that has been consumed, and turned it into the opposite of this, a child-friendly family flick that drones along to all the tired, over-used tropes we've all seen before.

This isn't a real film, this is just ""content"" designed to be consumed and forgotten.   I am shocked Simon St√•lenhag signed off on this. If you want to see a much better visual representation on film of his art, you're better off watching Amazons Tales from the Loop. ",1.5
"Love it, need more of this.

Could do with more character development and arc.
But these type of movies usually lack.

But i had a good experience and enjoyed the journey.",5
"This film has been panned by the critics. They are missing the point. The whole film is colourful, loud and ridiculous. It is fun, it was designed to be fun and I challenge anyone to watch it and not have fun. 

The evil Mr State is ridiculously over the top, Chris Pratt is a a hipster version of Starlord and Millie Bobby Brown produces her usual wide eyes over the top teenage angst. It is fabulous. 

The visual effects are cute, scary and clever. The story is simple and kinda dumb and the whole premise on which the story is based is daft. 

I loved every moment. ",5
A very cute movie. I loved the comedy between Millie Bobbie Brown and Chris Pratt. ,5
"It's a pretty cute and well put together movie which doesn't take itself too seriously. There are a few dumb moments at the end in the fight seen (like being able to miraculously walk into a secure building unnoticed) but if you ignore these few lazy directorial moments, the film is otherwise enjoyable. It's a bit teen sci-fi, but still a bit of a sci-fi romp for a more wordly sci-fi audience. ",4.5
"Great acting, cool story, and the production values were amazing.  The movie had lots of funny moments thanks to Chris Pratt and there were surprise cameos.  I really enjoyed if.  The critics giving this movie bad reviews are really just out of touch with what people like these days.",5
"It was a good enough plot with decent pacing of the storytelling, just a tad of the lulls. The concept wasn‚Äôt as good as the Matrix, but this was an interesting enough story to tell. Ignore the poor reviews of the critics, as I had been suspecting this as a willful effort for them to undermine the reputable quality of streaming movies. To think this was all in the comforts of my home, and I didn‚Äôt have to put in the effort to go to a movie house. This movie was good enough to have been released in cinemas.",3.5
unsure why the critics wrote reviews so low. it‚Äôs all in all a good film. The critics need criticism if you ask me!,5
It's not a unique adventure and the message it conveys can be a little too on the nose but with that being said it is definitely really fun and interesting to watch.,5
I always read reviews after I watch a movie and never before because I don‚Äôt want any kind of bias creeping into my enjoyment of them.   When I did for this one I couldn‚Äôt help but notice that if the movie received a bad review the reviewer mentions the budget.   Both on the critic and audience side.   You can‚Äôt help but think the review was more about the best use of the money than the actual movie ,3
"Absolutely loved it! One of those movies you can just sit back and enjoy the quirky humour and just fun.
The critics are wrong and sooooo boring! Go back to your cave criticmort.",5
"It's a good movie. I can't stand that the critics didn't like it. It had everything (action, drama, humor...) except a love interest but that would have made it cheesy. I definitely recommend it except for the kids because of the violence.",4
"Excelente muy sencilla en su trama pero interesante, super recomendable para ver con tu familia mucho mejor final que el de la novela ",5
"I could tell you this movie was great, and how they wasted no scenes and it was fun, touching, and full of full hearted excitement and emotion. That the critics were wrong, but truth is they were only PARTLY wrong.

Just read their reviews for yourself. One Top Critic said it best when he said ""This movie was slop just like Soylant Green."" Yeah? Soyalnt Green the AWARD winning, very popular movie that set the standard for dystopian movies?  Shows you how out of touch he is with the genre or movies in general. 

So don't take my word that this movie is a must see, listen to a TOP critic. If you care about the genre at all you'll give this a peep. And as luck would have it you can see it for free on Netflix and judge for yourself! ",5
"Definitely don‚Äôt expect the best dialogue or amazing character development.  But, Electric State has the fun Spielberg throwback thing happening and some excellent effects.  The song placement is fantastic.  If you want something fun to watch at home, It‚Äôs well worth your time.  Try not to soak up too many YouTube reviews, turn off your inner armchair critic‚Ä¶and enjoy some fun.",4
I watched this with my wife and 2 kids (7 and 8) . The movie was great and we had alot of fun watching it . The critics mark it low but i would disagree.,5
"  It is a good movie, In Brazil we have a TV channel that has a time that passes ""afternoon session"" (sess√£o da tarde) this movie is good to watch with family or parents, could mark many childhoods. But it's not something amazing. And the critics spoke badly of the appearance of the robots, well, I loved it XD Mixing technology with vintage stuff is cool. At least for me.",3
"The Electric State on Netflix is an interesting movie. Enjoyable for sure, the story‚Äôs main Character ‚ÄúMichelle‚Äù played by Millie Bobby Brown suffers a great loss in her brother who died in a crash during the war between Robots and Humans. The war at the time was going on as Robots believed they can be more than just useful items for the humans. Eventually a treaty was made, and a few years down the road Michelle ends up running into a wondering Robot. Destined to figure out what‚Äôs wrong, the Robot convinces her that it‚Äôs her brother trying to reach her to help find the main cause of what happened to him and how somehow he is still alive. Good movie, fun, action and comedy.",4
This movie was fun! The critics just don‚Äôt like Chris Pratt for political reasons. ,5
"The critics have never been more wrong. The Electric State is not just a fun family flick, it will end up being a cult classic like Batteries Not Included at the least, if not a beloved cultural icon like the original Star Wars. This film is full of great writing, great music, humor, and even great acting and voice acting. Nothing looks like CGI, and I'm sure much of the rumored $320 million budget was used to create some of the most amazing practical real-life animated robots that have ever appeared on film. Not to mention the fact that the landscapes and 90s feel of the Simon St√•lenhag graphic novel was faithfully reproduced down to the finest grain of haze and oily patina. I really loved this movie, and I can't imagine what's wrong with anyone who would say the horrible things about it that I've read in critics' reviews. ",5
Great family movie!  Action packed and sound track was great. ,5
I found the movie thoroughly entertaining and well done visually. And although I would've liked more dystopia and darkness the overall soft tone was fine in the end and I enjoyed it tremendously. ,5
"those critics were WRONG.

 this movie shows exactly what is happening in todays society; robots and AI taking over society. this movie was sad, yet heartwarming. I would definitely recommend this movie to show to the family.",5
"The movie is well paced and doesn't waste scenes. It keeps things lively and even though the story feels recycled, the implementation is flawless. Good movie. ",4
"Well, that was a waste of 2 hours and $330 million.  Some visually cool scenes, but some interesting storylines to go along with it would have been nice",0.5
"This was a fun creative movie. I have no idea why critics would hate it so much other than for political reasons. Regular movie goers seem to be enjoying it, as did I and my family!",5
Loved this. So well done. Will watch again with the kiddos ,5
"As usual, the critics are completely wrong It was a fun little adventure! Great for the whole family!  ",4.5
"I enjoyed the story, characters and the visuals were great. Good family movie.",5
"I don't understand why the movie rating is low, The movie is great! Well scripted, touching, great CG, it is worth the watch! ",5
"I absolutely loved this, dont listen to negative people hating on purpose because of the actors politics. It's a great movie",4.5
"These days it feels as though pretty much everything has been done before. Be it film, TV, music, etc. It's 2025 and, frankly, how long can completely original ideas keep turning up? Every film is influenced or inspired by something that came before, and I've long been disillusioned with it. That said, I typically go into watching something with the expectation that I will be disappointed, especially when it comes to adaptations.

That said, the book was excellent (a quick search will show that I'm not the only one who thinks so, it is a very well rated book), and I truly enjoyed this film as well. As did my spouse and she isn't particularly a fan of science fiction. I note the book because as I read through the reviews of most ""professional"" critics on here, I determined that many appear to be no better than couch coaches yelling at the TV during a sports game because an athlete did something that they didn't like, as if they could do better. I must say that it seems to be rather easy to park yourself down, watch a film, and then skewer it with shameless disregard instead of being the one *making* said film. Pompous, to say the least.

In closing, Simon St√•lenhag was involved in the creation of the adaptation (take heed anyone who is upset about the tonal shift between book and film), which isn't particularly surprising as the film is based off of his work. Personally, I feel that the poor reviews from the aforementioned critics are a bit of a slight against St√•lenhag as well. I suspect the majority of these critics don't read many books anyhow considering what they do for ""work"". 

P.S. Arguably worse than these critics who get paid to do what they do are those of the general audience who appear to be trying to emulate the paid critics with their banal attempts at criticizing with a negative quip.",5
"A fun movie to watch. Is it an all time best, no. Is it a nice break from remakes and super hero movies , yes. ",3
"This movie is sooooo bad, can‚Äôt believe they had a budget of 320 million‚Ä¶.",0.5
"I‚Äôm not sure why this already had bad reviews. This movie was great! Funny, heartfelt with a little action! A ton of big named actors in this movie too, so that mad it even more fun! ",5
"Great movie. Loved the screens with blurry scenes based on TV before HDTVs. I cried at most scenes. This was the best movie I‚Äôve seen since Transformers One.

Just wish they had less middle fingers and less swear words.",5
"Fun popcorn movie to watch, kid friendly if they are into sci-fi. It feels like it's meant to be just a sit down and relax type of movie. Not very thought provoking, kind of reminded me of a 90's kids movie.",4
"Great family movie, very entertaining, and has a strong cast. ",5
"The most hollow, lackluster trash I have seen in a while. Any feelings the book may have made you feel will be snuffed out by this DOA flick.",0.5
"This is a great movie. Ignore the critics, they get paid to write nonsense.",5
"A bewildering 2 FULL HOURS of nonsensical banter. Its story barely even feels like it came off the assembly lane, and the humans feel more robotic than the actual machines. Don't get me wrong, this movie had all the potential gears from it's source to make a profound pulpy spectacle, but instead we get an easily skippable movie that barely has an engine.",0.5
" I wasn't excited about the action scenes in the first few minutes. My family fell asleep in the first few minutes, so we had to watch it in parts. It lacks emotion, in my case. Chris Pratt's relationship with the robot, his story with the robot. It didn't do anything for me. And the brothers' relationship, either. It doesn't do anything for me, honestly. Sorry.",2.5
I wish I could rate these so-called ‚Äòtop critics‚Äô.  I‚Äôd give them a one out of five and that would be generous.   This movie is hard and is a must see.,5
"It's clear by now the Russos need a strong creative hand at the wheel guiding their decisions, considering their output post-Marvel has consistently resulted in uninspired cash-bonfires like this.",0.5
"Lack of realism in the small details, which makes it hard to immerse yourself in these post-war fictional world. Physics seem off, Millie has perfect makeup for three days straight and no one seems to eat ever.
Social interactions are forced, dialogues are border -cringe more than half of the movie. I was unable to connect emotionally with any of the characters or their situations. Cool concept, poor execution",1
"A joyless affair that apes elements from half a dozen better movies (including the Russos' own previous work under Marvel), just with less sincerity.",0.5
"This movie was a 10/10. Most people disliking it are 35+ years old and they‚Äôre upset about a movie because THEY didn‚Äôt like it. If you don‚Äôt like it don‚Äôt want it, it‚Äôs simple. I love movies like this that are creative and have side characters like this movie has.",5
"The movie itself isn't that bad, I found it quite creative exploring differing thoughts of robotics",4
Great family movie a must watch ,4.5
"Be weary of insanely awful reviews of a movie that doesn't warrant it. This is a fun flick. A bit long, yes. Still worth the trip.  When Hollywood doesn't consider actor(s)/Directors part of their elite... They try their best to kill it.  Hollywood sucks, fake critics suck, paid for algorithms suck .... This movies doesn't suck.  Real people have echoed the same sentiment.  Check out the film!",5
"I have never read the book so just watched for the fun of it and I enjoyed it. Millie Bobby Brown is definitely becoming one of my favorite actresses. Loved Chris Pratt's character. I enjoyed it and all the animation of the robots it felt real. Shout out to Stanley Tucci, awesome.  Great watch! Thank you.",4.5
"Esse neg√≥cio de cr√≠ticos avaliando j√° t√° ficando tedioso, o filme √© delicinha de assistir, √© filme pipoca, filme fam√≠lia, sess√£o da tarde, com um efeito especial espetacular, s√≥ sinto muito n√£o ter lan√ßado no cinema. Muito melhor que muito filme que est√£o dizendo ser ""t√£o bom"".",5
I saw the movie Friday night with my 19y old daughter and we both loved the it. It's both fun and entertaining and provides fruit for thought. When I see the reviews I have to wonder how they can have been so disapointed - its as if the reviewers refuse to accept the movie for what it is. They must have so sad lives with little enjoyment :-),5
"It's really bad.  Good for a sunday night time when you don't want to think at all.  It is that bad that I forgot the name.  A film full of clich√©s and a worn out plot.  A movie made by americans, for americans.",2
I have no idea why the critics slandered this one so much! Watched it as a family on Sunday night. So fine is the line of balance between technology and spending quality time with the real world. Loved the movie and would watch a prequel to see how Chris P‚Äôs character became who he was in this one. Great movie ,5
"Idc what anyone says, this was a good movie. It wasn't ground breaking, it wasn't written like The Hobbit, and it was kinda shallow. But it was sweet and funny and the characters were endearing. Nice family watch. ",4
"The critics are biased imagination deficient skeletons.  This movie was cute,  funny,  sad, and had veiled hints of the ""tire fire floating on an ocean of piss"" we live in.  (Movie reference!) ",5
It's so good. Best movie in 2025,5
"Fun movie, worth a watch.  It isn't going to change the world, but fun.",3.5
"Really not sure what movie the critics are talking about but I suppose I see some merit to their words, yeah it isn‚Äôt perfect but there‚Äôs an art style here and vibe that I love. The cast is okay, really wish they‚Äôd stop recycling these actors but the story was good, the action was mediocre but there‚Äôs visuals were greatly done. ",4.5
Not sure why the critics have rated this so low. I watched this with my wife and kids. We laughed we cried. Honestly a beautiful movie. ,5
"I have no idea why this is rated so badly. I have seen so many films that were much much worse. It may have many recycled tropes, it's basically Wall-E and a bunch of other movies combined. It has some unique twists though and some endearing characters. It is pure entertainment just like so many movies used to be--nothing more, nothing less. I recommend it if you want to escape from the world for a few hours, despite the film's theme to connect with others. Give it a shot!",3.5
Good family friendly movie. Seeing the critics' scores here tells you why nobody gives a crap what they say.,4
"Was The Electric State timeless? No. Was it a decent popcorn flick? Definitely. It does suffer from a few issues that a lot of modern movies have (a message that feels like it could be nudged harder in natural ways during the movie and less during the ending and Chris Pratt playing Star-Lord again), but that's about where my criticisms end. It's a fun popcorn movie. The art direction is good, Giancarlo Esposito is amazing (as one would expect), the action sequences are surprisingly clear and unmuddled, and they managed to make the Conspicuous Product Placement Character into an actual character that was one of the better parts of the movie. Kudos. ",4
"I highly enjoyed it. Some things felt a little rushed, but it was good. The sub 20 rating critics gave is way off the mark. It felt different and highly enjoyable.",5
"There is ao much negativity around this movie with the critics and if this film is the biggest bomb Netflix has ever had. I don't know  what others on their computers are thinking, but I had an absolute blast with this movie and wish to dive deeper into the lore of this franchise. 

I absolutely loved the characters, human or robot, and wished to dive a little deeper into Chris Pratt's characters back-story to get more of him as a person. I love Herm, Penny, PC, and the whole crew of robots we took this journey with and, I personally wish we could spend more time with them. 

The visual effects are brilliant, and never took me out of the film at all. I was invested in this story and the VFX only helped solidify that.

The Russo brothers are top notch with this film and made something fun, emotional, and intense. A roller coaster ride like a great film like this should be.  It's not shooting for an Oscar's level of film, but one you can escape into and have fun with. I had the best time with this and will definitely watch it a bunch more times!",5
I really enjoyed the movie. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea but it helped me destress from my day and relax. I really liked it. ,3.5
I loved it haters gunna hate I've actually watched it twice and enjoyed it even more the second time dont let critics dictate what film or tv you are gunna enjoy find out for yourself i highly recommend this movie! Also herm is my standout favorite had me dying the whole time especially during the climax absolutely epic!,4.5
"Good pace, great visuals, effective story telling and a fun movie to watch.  Are there flaws with it?  Sure.  But it was a good family movie and worth watching again.",4
"I have absolutely no idea why this is at 14%. I have seen far, FAR worse fare both on Netflix and at the box office. This was a fun, well animated movie. Millie Bobby Brown is adorable and Chris Pratt is not the worst version of Chris Pratt so it was definitely worth the watch. ",4
I enjoyed it.  I'm not sure what the critics were wining about.,4
Great movie to sit back and enjoy and leave the real word go away for a few hours. The story was engaging and visuals were fantastic! Such a very good cast that brought many CGI characters to life. They gave them life and made you care what happens to them. Also it imparts a narrative that there is good and bad in everything including our ever advancing technology. I will watch this many times. ,5
Critics are so harsh on this one lol definitely entertaining and a fun watch! ,3.5
"Critics hated it. So I definitely knew I would enjoy it. Worth the two hour watch on your couch with the family. Not the best movie ever made, but it was entertaining. ",4
Great movie for everyone !! Wish they had more movies like this for family!! I'm glad to see it!! In the world we live in now we need good humor and great distractions from our not so great society!! Thank you for doing this one right !! Recommend for everyone !!!  One more thing !! For the MOVIE CRITICS OUT THERE you are grown men and women  movie like these are for kids and teens to enjoy with parents it imaginative and inspires young adults !! Just because it's not filled with half naked women and gangs or drugs doesn't make it a bad film !! Get a real job that has nothing to do with movies thank you!!,5
"I don't understand the critical hate for the movie. It's far from perfect, you have leave your brain at the door, it has a lot of tropes, very spielsberg, but if this was released in theaters during the 90s the score would be a lot higher (excluding graphics). 

I had fun. More emotion than I expected, but honestly felt better than most of Netflix big action flicks ",4
Really enjoyed this for a Sunday night watch wrapped up on the couch. No issues following the plot or what they were trying to achieve and leaves itself open for a sequel that can expand on the very interesting world created. The little jokes and easter eggs scattered throughout the movie was very clever and appreciated. Very interested in reading the source material after seeing this.,4.5
This should be the first movie where the public can file a class action lawsuit for wasting everyones time ,0.5
Movie was pretty good. Special effects were good. Was  little long but it was worth it. ,3.5
"Sad and boring, MBB not ready to be a leading lady. Chris Pratt could not over ooze sarcasm enough to bring up the movie to a 60%.",1.5
"It's a solid 7.0 family movie, your not gonna remember of it in a couple of months but it's going to be worth 2 hours of your time in your own couch, it's entertaining, it's not amazing but it's not horrible. Great to watch with kids!",3.5
"Almost didn‚Äôt watch this movie based off of the rotten tomato review, glad I did anyways. The critics are being pretentious snobs because it was unique, entertaining, and not afraid to be itself. If your a normal person who is not just trying to dissect movies and just looking for something to enjoy like my wife and I were, it‚Äôs definitely worth a watch",5
"This is the first movie I‚Äôve ever rated on Rotten Tomatoes. I felt compelled to because it‚Äôs getting so much hate. 

It‚Äôs like candy. It‚Äôs fun and it looks great. It doesn‚Äôt provide hours of thought provoking material but a little meaningless escapism isn‚Äôt a bad thing.",4.5
Great family movie to watch. We thought it was great‚Ä¶This is one of those situations were the critics got it wrong!,4
I‚Äôm very disappointed with this movie. It was honestly awful.,0.5
"If the book didn't exist, then maybe there could be something positive to say about this movie, but the book does exist and this lame NETFLIX adaptation absolutely assaults it. Completely wrong tone. A bit like making a musical comedy out of War and Peace.

Terrible. Awful.

If you liked this, you might not like the book. They couldn't be more different.

The Russo Brothers really wasted an opportunity here. No dessert for them for the next five years straight.

(Amaz0n's adaptation of Tales from the Loop sucked, too, but that's another story ...)",0.5
"I enjoyed it quite a bit. No, it won't win an Oscar, but it was a fun adventure in one possible future where mankind and robots exist together. I do wish they had made the robots a bit more scary, but I can see that would not match the mood/message of the movie. ",4.5
"Not anything amazing but definitely wasn‚Äôt bad. The ending lacked flare with the acting but beyond that, there was action, story, and a heartfelt message. All in all solid, just it ground breaking",4
"I don‚Äôt know what people expect out of human/robot dystopia war cinema these days, but this was a fun, thoughtful and slick-looking action movie with a lot of heart.
it‚Äôs not a perfect movie by any means, but the short shrift it‚Äôs getting by critics doesn‚Äôt make any sense.",4
"It was fine. 'The Electric State' probably will not change the game, cost too much, but still provide a fun journey with robots in a distopic world. The production is ok, the effects fine and the story is more of the same, but still works for me. The interaction between the robots and Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt character worth the watch. It's feel like the source material is vastly superior, so I will look that soon.",3.5
Loved it thought the movie was great it was heartwarming funny and had a good story line ! ,5
This was a fun very watchable movie ‚Ä¶ critics opinions are just about worthless anymore ,4
"The story could of been great and reinvented, sadly it wasn't.   The poor acting and lack of atmosphere made a world hard to believe.   Plus the eye alignment from the cast towards the CGI prompts is terrible.  ",2
"14% is way to harsh, this is a nice, easy, enjoyable watch. ",3.5
"La cr√≠tica solo vislumbra fracasos mas que certeras obras de entretenimiento, no hagan caso a los pseudo cr√≠ticos y vean esta bella obra de arte.",4.5
"Excellent Syfy for the whole family.  My wife and I watched it, really good special effects,  very entertaining. ",5
"So sorry, but hey, let's typecast Chris Pratt and make a movie for kids that is painful to watch. Kids will probably like all the robots and fighting and hopefully get the message that too much technology can stifle human connections and creativity. However, having to spend the insane amount of money on something that could have been CGI makes me quite disappointed. ",1
"I liked it, great escape for 2 hours.   Well done...",5
"So much hating on this film, I absolutely loved it. E.T meets  I robot meets toy story meets ....it's  a bit of everything and just a feel good movie....sometimes the critics get it wrong. Just see it for what it is. Chill. ",5
"What a fun movie dont listen to the critics, its wonderfully enjoyable",5
CGI was great and it was a good story. But it was really slow in parts and about 40 minutes too long ,3.5
"What a family movie, the kids loved as did I, the SFX are fantastic and there was some very funny and heartfelt scenes, great cast to boot. Ignore the critics they talk a load of rubbish, just to make themselves feel important in the film world but really their opinions have no real importance in anyone's life as it's just whether you enjoyed it at the end of the day! ",5
"(No spoilers!) My wife and I just watched it and loved it. The story is good but what makes it great is the CGI. Without fantastic CGI, this would have been unwatchable. But it works, so definitely get the family together and enjoy!",5
"Another huge divide between the jaded ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù critics and the audience. Makes you wonder how good they are at their job if they are so far removed from the opinions of the general public they are supposed to be influencing. Was it an amazing movie, no. Was it entertaining, yes. It could have been better at introducing more humor and using the cast of characters at hand, but it is still an enjoyable piece of art overall. Every performer was on point and the visuals are amazing. I think the story is kind of rushed and predictable, but still maintains the entertainment factor. It‚Äôs another decent tale that the critics enjoy turning their nose up at.",4
"An absolute disappointment. How could they waste the budget in such a foolish way? The movie is painfully predictable and full of clich√©s. For adults, it feels childish; for kids, it‚Äôs too mature. It‚Äôs a shame when projects like this get made‚Äîthey crush any hope for quality sci-fi in the future because who would fund it after this?",0.5
My kids and I all had fun. What more do you want? ,4
"Easy to watch and very entertaining, never a dull moment.  Loved the action, characters and all the cool robots.  It's always amazes me how paid critics both dump crap on a good movie like this and rave about so movies that most people don't enjoy.",5
"I go into every movie hoping to get through to the end feeling satisfied. I most certainly was with The Electric State. 
Cast played their roles well, cgi was great and the story was solid enough to keep myself and the kids engaged. We were able to follow what and why things were happening, while having laugh out loud moments and heart felt sad spots. 
The critics that give this a terrible rating are out of touch with what movies are supposed to be. ",4
"Worth the 2 hour watch! Admittedly the script doesn't favour Millie or Chris well, but it works. Great entertainment that all the family will enjoy. ",4
"Renewed my Netflix subscription just to watch this movie. I love this kind of movies, don't care what critics say",5
Really enjoyed the imagination of the story. Great film for the family. Honestly don't understand the low ratings by the critics.,4
"Critics got this wrong. Badly.

Whilst the budget isn't really obvious in the film it does what it set out to do. It's fun, all be it long. 

Might have worked better as a series to be fair, but it's not a fizzler like the overhyped critics will let you believe ü§∑",4.5
"O filme √© divertido, achei os personagens tinham uma boa qu√≠mica e a hist√≥ria me pegou. Gostei do filme.",4
"honestly, the story is kind of rushed, and the pacing is wayyy off. some scenes are rushed and others are dragged on. however, that being said, i haven‚Äôt seen special effects and cgi THAT good since pacific rim. well worth the watch if you respect and love well made cgi. honestly they spent all that money solely on social effects and NOT paying the writers.",3.5
"Some critics bashed this movie.    I will say, turn it on and just enjoy the Characters and the movie.    I absolutely loved it and kept me riveted to the screen till the end.    Some critics are trying to compare it with other movies.   You will either love it or hate.  I loved it!!!!!",5
The movie was solid but admittedly there was something lacking that really didn‚Äôt hit home with the emotionally elements that it seemed was its intent. Overall though I‚Äôve seen a lot worse and honestly worth the watch if you see yourself drawn to it,3.5
"I read a review somewhere saying this was the worst movie ever made ..they were right. The film reminded me of a really bad 1980s era Spielberg film...Not only is it a horribly bad film, why is Millie Bobby Brown always, always, always wearing heavy makeup and lipstick? Again, avoid this film at all costs....but wait, maybe, just maybe this is the replacement for the Rocky Horror Picture Show? Will we get stoned off our asses, go to watch Electric State and thrown toy robots and toilet paper at the screen? Will people get up and dance on stage? Yeah, this could be a great thing....!",1
Fun movie with a great cast,5
"Ignore the critics, this was a great movie! Yes easy to guess the plot buuuut a funny, nostalgic, political, clever, heart breaking and visually  engaging movie it was for sure! I‚Äôve never written a review before but just wanna put my pennies worth in because these guys should get some credit, great movie who clearly know their target audience and was great to watch at home over the weekend. But agree with other reviews, would have been even more amazing in cinema and think some areas of the plot could have been explored deeper as it would have made it even more of a complex and interesting watch. Buuut such a clever and fun film with references to classic movies and characters! üòä",4
I absolutely loved this. Great humor. Great story. Great acting. I highly recommend this as a fun family film. My two teenage boys loved it too. ,5
"I really enjoyed this movie, is a cool mix of stunning visuals and emotional moments. It follows a touching story about family and survival in a futuristic world. Definitely worth watching if you're into sci-fi with heart.

",5
"Millie really is not her best. She seems mechanical like the robots. This is a terrible script for Chris Pratt, very bland. But overall, it‚Äôs worth a
 Watch just for the special effects if nothing else. I seriously doubt that we will see a part 2. If you start it with the proper expectation, you will likely enjoy it. It has such a seasoned actors, it could have been better. Still, check it out and don‚Äôt listen to the critics that seem more out of touch than ever before.",3
Fun movie for all the family! enjoyed it a lot more than I expected ,5
"Pretty good, nice acting, good for a movie night. ",3.5
"Easy the biggest self own by the critics all prejudging this film based only on its budget. 
Great fun film. Good heart. Kinda exactly the type of film my family has been hoping for these days. 
",5
I don‚Äôt know why people don‚Äôt like this movie I think it was very good,4
"Was it ground taking? No. 
Was it thought provoking? No.
Was it a fun watch on the weekend with nothing else to do but laze around? Absolutely!
From actor spotting and looking at each other going ""oh hey! It's that one actor...."" to all the 80/90's references and cool robots - it was just fun, bubblegum for the brain. 

",4
Great movie the whole family can watch together. Ignore the critics and judge it for yourself. We‚Äôve given many a movie a go based on wonderful critic reviews that we enjoyed far less than this one. Have realistic expectations people. ,5
"I thought it was different  and a pleasant watch.
Quite a touching story line.
 
Tom Selleck was in a film called runaway where the machines started to attack humans i think that's the oldest film I've seen apart from the android in Alien.. but with all the AI fears out there it's still interesting to see films like this. 

Shame it's been slated so much. ",3.5
What I‚Äôve learned never trust a clown of its opinion of a movie.  It may come as shocking but not everyone wants to watch same gender love stories.  Being born in the 70‚Äôs and growing up in the 90‚Äôs I will say this seems very period correct. In a way it‚Äôs a reversed roll of the movie cherry 2000.  This is actually better then borderlands which has too much appeal to the peanuts instead of the main population.  In fact I‚Äôve watched it twice in the same week which I never do.  ,5
"Dont understand the hate for this movie. I enjoyed it a lot and it had a great message also
",4
I enjoyed it. Great movie to watch with older kids (9 years+). Pretty well done robotic graphics too.,4
"Don‚Äôt get the critic hate - enjoyable, visually stunning popcorn flick.",5
"So Electric State has 15% from critics and 80% from viewers. Meanwhile Emelia Perez is the other way round. Which movie would you rather spend a couple of hours of your time watching? It is a good movie, plenty of action and interesting ideas that weren't really explored. The SFX are incredible and worth watching for that alone. My only gripe is it would have been better as an 8 episode season on Netflix as they could have explored the different robots' backgrounds in flashback.",4.5
"Just when I thought Hollywood had forgotten how to make an original, funny, and visually stunning sci-fi movie, The Electric State comes along and proves me wrong. The Russo brothers, best known for delivering Avengers: Endgame, the last truly great Marvel movie, have done it again‚Äîthis time crafting a heartfelt, imaginative adventure that resonated with my entire family.

The film‚Äôs ability to make you care deeply about a tiny robot, despite its limited screen time, is something I haven‚Äôt seen in years. That level of emotional storytelling, combined with breathtaking special effects and a unique vision, makes The Electric State a standout.

In a world flooded with forgettable content, this is the kind of movie that reminds me why I keep my Netflix subscription active while ignoring the rest. If Hollywood made more films like this, the industry wouldn‚Äôt feel so lost.",4.5
"I don‚Äôt get the criticism. This has real heart - the cgi robots have characters as believable as anything in the original Star Wars, and my 11-year old daughter loved it. Proper family fun. ",5
Terrible. Awful movie ,1
"Well now here we go!  It's easy to tell when critics fail to see the fact that a popcorn movie is just that.  This one is beautiful, imaginative, engaging and worth every minute because first and foremost it is entertaining.  I think this one is probably the most watchable original movie I've seen on Netflix.  I feel sorry for anyone too wrapped up in their own in their own little ball to find facination in this Masterpiece!",5
This movie was so fun! I truly loved it. My kids loved it too. I genuinely don‚Äôt understand the critics. ,5
"An amazing movie, a great movie for kids with a heartwarming story.",5
"I really enjoyed how the story was set up. I viewed it as, ""What if the Robot Uprising in ""The Matrix"" happened in the early 1990's, and the robots lost?"" Seeing how Titmouse did the 2D animation scenes for the ""old Cosmo Show"" was great. I also really enjoyed the banter between Chris Pratt's and Anthony Mackie's characters.",5
"Great visuals and fx but so too are found in Transformers movies.  Story or lack of may be worst here than Transformers.  The robots here lack character development and creativity.  AI the movie has better robots.  The Planters robot is annoying, fugly, and pure product placement.  The Stanley Tucci character delivers the best line that sums up this movie, ""Who cares?""",1
"I‚Äôve seen films that deserve a 15%, this was not one of them.

I never write reviews, but I felt compelled after seeing the critical response to this movie. No, The Electric State does not offer us a unique story nor will it be heavy hitter in award season; however, they made a decent film.

There was enough backstory to care about the characters, well-timed comedic relief, and impressive visual effects. Overall, it was enjoyable and engaging. At what point do we fire the critics?",4
"I have watched this movie two times already. It's not endgame or infinity war, but it is a good movie, and it has heart. ",5
Enjoyable but poor casting choose. Mille is not the right actor for this film (not at 20/21‚Ä¶ maybe at 13 could have been more plausible,2.5
Loved it. Lovely movie for kids. ,5
"The Electric State - 4/10. Soulless. That‚Äôs the word for this film. What‚Äôs sad about this megabudget film (rumoured to cost upwards of 300 million dollars), is that it just feels like a lot of ideas and thoughts thrown towards a board, and just hoping they would stick well with each other. The Electric State a movie that seems adamant on its visuals to wow you. Yes, its kinda fun and cool to see the nostalgia of the 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs pop culture things showered all over this. Seeing Mr. Peanut as one of the main characters is kinda interesting I guess? But just because you jam pack the movie with familiar things and with wall to wall special effects doesn‚Äôt mean you have a good movie in hand. Millie Bobby Brown has nothing really to work with here, and I felt like her performance is hampered due to the writing. For a big budget film, they could have easily given Chris Pratt a better wig. He just seems to be here, but again, none of the material is helping his respective performance. You got stars galore here in voice roles, but again, it doesn‚Äôt matter when the performances just feel dull due to the writing. I really can‚Äôt for the life of me think of a moment in this movie where I genuinely felt entertained. It just felt like I was waiting or anticipating it to pick up. It felt like the Russo‚Äôs threw a bunch of robot based movie plots into a blender and conjured up the story here. Instead of making a smoothie, it turned out to be a sloppy mixture. The Russo‚Äôs have a sense of flair with their visuals. I love their work on Community, and their respective work in Marvel is good. But I feel like they have coasted on great visuals and spectacle for quite some time. Not one joke or gag made me laugh whole heartedly or made me chuckle. Not one scene felt amazing to the point where I couldn‚Äôt wait for what‚Äôs gonna happen next. The Russo brothers should really start looking into working with better writers. Regardless of how their return to the MCU goes, this and their work in between their MCU stints have shown that they really need to hone their original ideas more thoroughly. Its a sad waste of money here, and this is one of those movies that would have easily been a more entertaining short film, or, possibly, a miniseries (though, I don‚Äôt think more of this would be better). Its not a terrible film, but its also one that just feel uninspired and tired and dull.",2
"My initial thoughts were ""It's not the worst movie you could spend 2 hours with, especially if you're looking for something inoffensive and family-friendly. 2 stars"" It's got a neat premise, a stellar cast and incredible CGI. It is also a wildly different story than its excellent source material - which I think really let down a lot of the critics who gave it such lousy reviews. 

As I've thought about it some more, I've become increasingly annoyed about how much it squanders its neat premise with some incredibly silly plot holes and lazy, poorly explained story beats. 
(It's never explained how the robots became sentient; the ""post robot-war new order"" relied on one particular human staying alive and imprisoned indefinitely, with no redundancy or failsafe - despite the fact that eventually ALL humans die; Chris Pratt just straight up plays ""Starlord,"" down to the cadence and accent; now that robots are ""free,"" do they become citizens? What kinds of rights do they get? Can't we still make autonomous robots that don't utilize whatever technology was advanced enough to allow robots to develop sentience? If not, why not? Now that the humans are somehow incapable of utilizing the billions of dollars worth of formerly remote-controlled robo-drones, what keeps a violent, rebellious sect of robots from violently revolting again if they don't feel like thy're being treated fairly enough? The ""positive"" note it ends on doesn't really resolve human-robot relations in any meaningful way.) If you're too young and/or uncritical to care about these things, enjoy the gorgeous CGI and the megastar cast. 


",0.5
It's not quite Love and Monsters. It's a bit Ready Player One. The scripts nothing new. Chris Pratt is fun enough. MBB is a bit intense as usual. Critics have been harsh. It's good enough for a streaming movie.,3
"Wow, I am shocked to discover so much hate for this film. We knew nothing about it prior to it's release and really enjoyed it. 
The animation and effects were good, the acting was pretty good. It was a bit formulaic but no worse than any other modern movie. 
We would probably watch it again if it was on TV.
Yeah, genuinely surprised at the response",4.5
"This movie was awesome. I don't know what the critics were thinking in giving this movie a bad time. Maybe the company didn't payed them to talk good about it, like they do with some movies. Granted the violence in action scenes were toned down for PG purposes and made less espectacular because of it, i never felt disappointed, because it fit the movie.

I loved the robot designs. For the most part, they looked like vintage toys, which gave the movie a really cool aesthetic.

Everyone did a great job acting, but the best character was definitely Anthony Mackie's Herman. I  hope they do a sequel or even a prequel, with him and Chris Pratt. Their chemistry was awesome and the character stole every scene he was in.

And the final moments of the movie just made it all better and brought a ton of heart to a charming movie to begin with. 

I would love to see a sequel. I think if they polish a few things, they could have something especial here.

",4
"Yeah, Wolverines! This movie was the kind of spectacle I didn't think Id find in March. ",5
"I went into this with very low expectations due to the online backlash against this film. Gotta say it's a decent family film. The plot is signposted a mile away, you know the villain/plot twist/ending way before they happen but who cares go and give it a watch, much worse put there for sure.",3.5
"Entertaining as hell, loved the story! The robots are amazing, and the CGI looks astonishing ",5
I sat through this movie hopping it would get better and it never did,1
Very good movie. Enjoy the story and the visuals.,5
"Hermosa pel√≠cula, mezcla comedia y drama perfectamente, el reparto es fenomenal y es bastante digerible, un mensaje profundo y positivo, yo le doy un 100! ",5
"It's a nice movie like one of those corny 80s adventure movies. Not every movie is meant to ""change your life"". Sometimes, we just want to have some fun and this flick fits in just fine.",4
"Although the script is not necessarily as though provoking as may have been intended, I found this to be a fun family watch.  There is violence but it is robot violence, minimal to zero blood.  The kids seemed to enjoy this movie a lot.",4
"A visual masterpiece dragged down by its script. There‚Äôs no heart and soul to this story, I spent more time admiring the CGI than caring about the characters. ",2.5
"Wow, what is everyone complaining about? This is a sick world if we've become so desensitized that we trash an""AWESOME"" Netflix production over our personal politics! My kids loved it and that's all that matters...",4.5
"SPOILERS! If you loved the movie just skip my review please.

Good - I fell in love with Herm the robot.

Bad - Oh boy.... Although I enjoy all the actors in the movie (and honestly the cast is great) the move just doesn't make any sense. The plot holes are pretty big and I am usually OK with that if the movie is fun but it's just kinda predictable.

Details - The tele-presence system supposedly relies on this ONE kids brain to function. Yep, one single comatose kids brain runs billions of remote controlled robots and his mind must be present to work the system. And if he dies the whole thing shuts down instantly.So all these military systems, airplanes, nuclear power plants, etc.. just immediately lose their pilots, controllers and operators. Cars would crash, refineries would explode, planes would crash, military bases would shutdown. It's not realistic.

And there is a no man's land of robots that if a human breaks into the area, the robots are in violation of a treaty and are in big big trouble. Nobody in the robot world is to blame but they are the one's in trouble and subject to execution.

And the robots all look goofy, cute, fun etc... not a single robot ever decided that ""hey, maybe I would enjoy life better if I didn't look like Mr. Peanut?!""

Also, there is ZERO military control over the exclusion zone. Just a bunch of robots that promise not to go over or under the wall however a random kid, a thief and a corporate goon can get in and out.

The near adult female child is under house arrest from a single male foster parent who obviously is only there to use her as a paycheck and nobody seems to think it's weird that an older man wants to foster a 16/17 year old girl... sure that's fine, no ulterior motive there.

The robots in the exclusion zone seem to be able to get electricity somehow and the doctor that's hiding out there seems to have WiFi, food and clothing without any issue.

The robots that were at war with all of humanity don't execute the three humans that wander into their camp. They feed them and develop friendship with the pretty much overnight.

Sorry the actors got stuck with the story. Hopefully the book did a better job.",2.5
"It's not perfect and it's definitely not the book. But it's a fun ride, it's got heart and underneath the surface it has something to say about technology and society. ",4
A fun movie to watch with your family. We really enjoyed it.,4
I don't know why everyone is saying this is a bad movie. I thought it was pretty good. ,5
"Adventurous, humorous, emotional, meaningful, touching. 

It's also a very nice story. Fun movie! It reminds me of a different story, but in it different way made.

Highly recommend this!",5
Don‚Äôt listen to the high-standard critics‚Äîthis movie is a phenomenal masterpiece. They‚Äôre more focused on whether a film checks the boxes of the current agenda than on appreciating its actual substance.,5
"I believe all of this movie's hate is politically motivated. It's fun, funny, dramatic, it tugs at heart strings and nostalgia, it looks great!!, the characters seem genuine and smart and very well acted, just overall five stars five stars five stars. I've read reviews with: heartless, soulless, flat, even said this damages all movies coming after it. that's just ridiculous just nonsense this is really a great heartwarming funny beautiful family movie.",5
Fun. That's all I'm gonna say. Just damn right fun! ,5
Hay tantos robots que uno se confunde. Trama muy lenta y previsible ,2.5
"This movie is unwatchable. Conceptually you feel like there‚Äôs something there, but the execution is awful. A bad script coupled with messy direction all lead to an excruciating watch. Side note: a slew of 5 star reviews from audience members who haven‚Äôt reviewed anything else. When will RT put a stop to this type of score manipulation‚Ä¶",0.5
"Was definitely a good movie. It's tiresome to read the critics reviews. They constantly get it wrong. They keep themselves in high regard and act as though they understand cinema More so then the ""average joe"". But the numbers don't lie. I honestly believe the critics section should be banished from this site. It's a bunch of pompous nitwits who don't represent the real movie going audiences!! Revolution!!",4
"Totally engaging and entertaining family movie. Some original ideas, some borrowed. Who cares?
We went in with no expectations, having only found the movie the night before watching it.
We shared a few laughs as our 10 year old cuddled into me. Isn‚Äôt that what any family wants from downtime.
Some of these critics clearly aren‚Äôt parents.",4
"Good movie, gets you in the feels, it‚Äôs seems like the bad reviews come from people‚Äôs political views that don‚Äôt align, which is sad, enjoy a movie for what it is",4.5

"This is a fun adventure, with an ET/Goonies/Guardians of the Galaxy vibe. If you like the artistic style of the latest Fallout series, you will love the artistic direction of this film. A great watch!",5
Not understanding the hate this movie is receiving. I never write reviews but I‚Äôve got to for this one. Amazing. Loved every minute of it I don‚Äôt think there will be a second one but I would certainly watch it. Millie and Pratt were a great team on this one. I was laughing I was intrigued. L-l-l-lovedddd it sorry for anyone that hated it. ,5
"I just bought a car. A used 2019 Toyota Camry. This movie reminds me of it. I bought it to fit my life and mean something to my work, family, and future. Nothing special; nothing a car magazine would gush over, turn heads, or be at your local car show. But my kids love it, my wife is thankful for something reliable, and I am happy I get to work every day to make something of life. The critics work for the magazine and know when they see fine engineering, but they clearly are disconnected from real life. This movie tells a classic story, sure, and dystopian themes are all over the road. But the story of friendship, family, love, and sacrifice just received another worthy skin in this movie, and I loved it.",5
"I must say that I didn't expect much from this movie but was positively surprised. When I've decided to check it on, I did not expect much from it but hoped to at least have some fun watching it. I do not regret watching it. I've really enjoyed the time I've spend with this movie. Maybe it is not a Hollywood blockbuster or a cinematic art and probably won't get an Oscar either, but it's a very well done original idea movie and I like original ideas much more then all those reboots and remakes that movie studios are constantly pushing just for a cheap cash grabs. This was a good original movie and it was fun.",3.5
"I watched this because it seems the critics hate it and my entire life i never liked or cared about what those critics thought hahaha, but it turns out to be a really fun movie!! The cgi is soo stunning! my eyes were truly blessed, the comedy is pretty funny, and I absolutely love the storyline. It‚Äôs genuinely an entertaining movie, perfect for a good time and it‚Äôs family friendly. But seriously, i feel like this is deserves to be on the big screen, not just on Netflix. ",5
read the book this is based on. just a boring and bland movie. misses the atmosphere and point of the book. chris pratt just being chris pratt in this movie. only good thing about this movie is its visuals.,1
"A kiddified version of Terminator with goofy looking robots, big ideas and big stars but apart from the visuals, none of the elements are used to great effect.  The alternative 90‚Äôs style and blend of robots with live action looks good but rather than being humorous, the film focuses on the drama of the story, making some scenes absurd and others just bad.  The film is too long with too many plot holes and apart from the lead, the other characters‚Äô motivations are lacking or contrived. ",2
"I thought it was a very enjoyable watch. It had all the elements of a great family film. Has the emotional of journey that some of my favourite films portray, friendship, loss and victory to name a few. Would happily watch this again when my kids are a little older. ",4
"It may be time for ‚Äúcritic reviews‚Äù to be evaluated. Who decides what makes someone worthy of the title of film critic? What a ratio. This was an enjoyable movie with an entertaining plot, good cinematics, lack of overt political views other than getting off our phones and enjoying life like we used too.  Watched with my teens and it was a good family movie night ",4
I don‚Äôt get the hate on this movie it‚Äôs a really solid movie from Netflix I actually really love the story and the Characters and the humour is actually pretty funny and the CGI is on a different level with the action it‚Äôs just amazing and I recommend you watch it if you want a fun action packed story about a girl who lost her brother but finds out he‚Äôs still alive and goes in a wild goose chase trying to find him with a robot,5
The fact that this movie is getting so much hate is ridiculous!!! Did we watch the same movie? This was seriously the best movie I have seen in a really long time. It made me laugh and cry! The robots were out of this world amazing! It was a beautiful film! I have never in my life taken the time to rate a movie. But this movie touched me so much I HAD to rate it!!! It‚Äôs a great movie! Anyone who hated it doesn‚Äôt have a soul quite frankly. ,5
Great movie. Definitely a family movie night with this. ,5
Really boring. And worst 2 hours of any life. I had to fast forward a lot of it.,0.5
Terrible movie. Awful story and acting to match.,0.5
"Critics take themselves way too seriously and clearly were looking for something this film never meant to provide.  It‚Äôs fun, with a little campy tug on the heartstrings to help push it along. The only thing I took from the reviews is that I would hate to be watching anything with those clowns in the room. ",3.5
"I figured it out! üòú

A gem among gems. This movie is apparently astronomically underrated. But I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder. So when I see so much hate‚Ä¶it only makes me wonder, is it merely just the reviewers own projection?

Time will tell. ",5
"My wife and I watched this movie and enjoyed it. It was fun story of adventure that went by very quickly. The ending left is with hope and a little hint of a possible sequel.

I was surprised to see the professional critics reviews. I believe the critics are trying hard and overthinking things too much. They're out of touch with your average movie watcher. ",4
"The Russos deliver a 90‚Äôs nostalgic vibe to a futuristic world, whilst slow to begin with, the story is weighted, full of heart and has some entertaining moments. I suggest a good couple of watches but ultimately it‚Äôs a film that is more aimed at the young audiences. An enjoyable watch but not a film the Russos have made that one would suggest to others to watch compared to other hits on their resume ",3.5
I quite enjoyed this film. For fans of Milly I would recommend this as it had a decent story line and an apocalyptic feel with hints of 5 nights at Freddy‚Äôs. ,3.5
"The Electric State:
A Touching Take On The Robot Apocalypse

Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, written by Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, and author of the source material/graphic novel, Simon Stalenhag, and starring Chris Pratt, Millie Bobby Brown, and Woody Harrelson, The Electric State is a surprising, fun, and heartfelt take on a robot apocalypse. 

Set in the mid-90s after humanity wins a war for robot independence, The Electric State follows teenage Michelle, played by Stranger Things Alum Millie Bobby Brown, in the aftermath of a tragedy. The world has become complacent and lazy with the introduction of new technology. Technology that Michelle is not only opposed to but soon discovers has a direct and disturbing connection to her family. 

Despite Chris Pratt playing the familiar comedic and bumbling cad, Keats, he plays well opposite his versatile robot bestie, Herman, voiced by Anthony Mackie. The star-studded cast includes Woody Harrelson, Anthony Tucci, Ke Huy Quan, Alan Tudyk, Jenny Slate, Jason Alexander, and Giancarlo Esposito. All give entertaining performances be it voice or on screen. 

Despite the old-hat character performance from Pratt, The Electric State offers beautiful visuals, a surprisingly deeply emotional plot, and a welcome original story, making this film a great watch that you won‚Äôt regret.

"We really enjoyed The Electric State.  Masterful script, humor can at the right time & action packed.  Very good message in the movie as qell.",5
"Absolutely terrible film, some good actors in it but it‚Äôs just so bad. Watched it with my 14 year old son who is a massive Chris Pratt fan but even he thought it was terrible. I oh so wanted it to be good but sadly its not ",0.5
Solid movie! Plenty of humor throughout. This is exactly why critic reviews are worthless. ,4.5
"Es una historia que emociona y te hace reflexionar,  me encant√≥ ",5
This movie is heartwarming and exciting. It keep me in my seat wanting more. Movie critcs doesn't know a good movie when they see one. The story is movie and the animation is outstanding. the movie should be longer,5
"A fun and heart felt movie. The story kept me intrigued and engaged, wanting to know more about all of the background and side characters. Anthony Mackie totally made this movie! His comedic timing and quick wit enhance every scene he is part of. Special effects and CGI never felt lack luster. My family was thoroughly entertained from start to finish. And the music is awesome!",5
The movie is fantastic. Despite what all the so-called expert critics think. I watched it with an 11-year-old and she loved it as well. It's funny emotional exciting heartwarming. This is the first review I've ever written for a movie and the main reason I am writing it is because the critics are lighting this movie up and they don't know s***.  Peace out ,5
"Es una pel√≠cula fresca, f√°cil de digerir, es una manera diferente de ver la inteligencia artificial. La pel√≠cula me mantuvo pegado a la pantalla de principio a fin",5
"Ignore the critics reviews! The movie is incredibly entertaining and emotional, I haven't cried this much since GOTG3. It's visually estimulating with the 90s robot retro technology. Every single frame of the movie is impressive and impecable. 
Everyone complains everything is a sequel or reboot. THIS IS ORIGINAL and I hope it gets a sequel.",5
This movie wasn‚Äôt even as bad as the critics had it out to be. I liked the plot and the characters and I felt like it had a lot of heart in it. I think it was a pretty good movie.,3.5
It‚Äôs a wasted 320$ million dollars if the producers kept it simple from the book. it definitely could have been better. Had lots of potential to be a great film. Extremely disappointed. ,0.5
This movie‚Äôs script directing acting and editing felt soulless. Going through the motions of emptiness and  vapid dialogue. What a disaster for a movie that cost that much. ,0.5
I thought it was entertaining. It was fun to try to guess who all of the voice actors were. I'd watch it again. ,4
"Forget about the critics, most of these people need to find a new job and stop hating on everything that comes out. 

Sit down, and just forget about the world around you for 2 hours. The movie was entertaining and while dystopian it was not too dark.
You can simply enjoy this as a family and have a good time together. If you like the 90s music, you will have some great songs popping up. 

This was an easily consumable, well done movie. You are paying for Netflix already, so just go watch it. ",5
"Why did Chris Pratt agree to this film? Love him , hated the movie. The good: the artistic creativity of the robots. The bad: Placing the robots over a little boy's life, making a statement referencing to robots , The Father, The Son and The Holy Ghost "" is pure blasphemy Plot what plot??. Did the ""Christian"" Pratt not fully read the script? Over 300 million dollars spent on garbage  could have built homes and fed the homeless.",1
"The Electric State is getting called a flop by critics, but I was engaged every second. It hit that perfect mix of humor and heart, with a strong Fallout and Zombieland vibe. The world felt real, almost nostalgic, like stepping into a version of childhood memories twisted by time.

The storytelling was solid, the pacing never dragged, and the emotional beats landed without feeling forced. It didn‚Äôt try to shove a message down my throat‚Äîjust let the characters and world speak for themselves. I appreciated that it didn‚Äôt lean into Netflix‚Äôs usual trends, but honestly, that was an afterthought. The film stood on its own, and that‚Äôs what mattered.

Critics might call it a miss, but for me, it was a win.",5
"Fun, Great CGI, stellar cast, and a unique and interesting story.",5
"Ignore the critic reviews, this was a very fun watch. Great cast and great story with a lot of heart. ",5
"Tiene su encanto, pero se que al saber el presupuesto que se inviertio y su directore, me parece que le falt√≥ algo, me gusta sus efectos ",3.5
I thought it was ok. A little on the cheesy side but ok.,3
"Efeitos especiais incriveis robozinho √© o melhor de todos achei invrivel a grande batalha, mesmo n√£o sendo uma historia impactante teve momentos que senti d√≥ dos robos mesmo eles sendo maquinas nao humanas kk",5
Wish I could have those hours of my life back. Such a frustrating movie because it had so much potential and flopped extra extra hard. ,1.5
Really fun to watch !,5
"The Electric State es una buena pel√≠cula. La historia tiene sentido, visualmente es atractiva y resulta entretenida. No se entiende del todo el rechazo, porque cumple con lo que propone. Si te gusta la ciencia ficci√≥n con una est√©tica bien lograda, vale la pena verla.",5
"Though I have seen mixed reviews so far, I would recommend the film for a cosy afternoon with the family. It has a great cast, a heartwarming story and an authentic setting. I am a huge fan of the 50s dystopian style, similar to Fallout, that comes from the robots - even though it was supposed to have happened in the 90s onwards. The concept is typically believable with the possibilities of AI and human response. It could have stretched further with some shocking twists, and most of the action was over quickly yet spread evenly throughout. Perhaps this would have worked better as a series, where each section could have been explored further to immerse the watcher better, rather than skimming through at pace. Nevertheless, I loved each of the characters, and Chris Pratt brought his usual dry humour. It felt typical from the Russo brothers in that I felt it covered everything I wanted for a happy afternoon chilling out with a film. Thank you for cheering up a rainy weekend, Netflix. I would happily go back to this and could see it becoming a family classic over time.",4
"Will go down in history as one of the worst movies per dollar of budget expended.  It's truly a sight to behold, rivals Postman and Waterworld in terms of just how bad it truly is.",0.5
"This is one of those movies that is thoroughly enjoyed only when you ""suspend reality""! After all, most movies have ""plausible premise"" and ""implausible storyline."" And while others will tell you it grants optimistic viewers the higher power of knowing how things are going to work out; so what? Allow yourself to enjoy the flow! The movie is HIGHLY creative. Animation is top drawer. Chris Pratt has a familiar ""Han Solo-type"" role but delivers a more fragile feel than his typical hero. Millie BB plays the rescuer to a T. Visually stunning with a solid soundtrack. Give yourself over to abandonment and watch it! ",5
"The critics are increasingly becoming an inbred class of irrelevant elitist morons. The Electric State isn't the most original film ever made, but the characters are likable and the script delivers some moral questions, heartfelt moments, and some chuckles as well as some very well done special effects (think, District 9), and some memorable robots. Pratt and Brown are both enjoyable leads, and I would watch it again. ",4
I think the Russos make the perfect middling ‚Äî expensive yet boring ‚Äîbe on your phone ‚Äî kind of films. Not offensive and completely forgettable ,1
"I tried to get through it.  Love the cast and book, but it felt very blah, very cookie cutter.  Jason Alexander can't catch a break.  ",0.5
People are looking for the most incredible movie instead of just a fun alternate timeline movie. This story line is not a multiple movie series like endgame. It just a fun movie about an alternate timeline where ai and technology advance out of our control. Enjoy the ride. ,3.5
"This movie does not deserve the slapping down it is receiving.

This is no next epoch of cinema, however it is greatly entertaining for the visuals alone. Maybe in terms of money it can smell a bit rancid, but the sets, actors and effects all held up for me and i had a great experience.

Having previously seen Tales from the Loop (Same Author), this is far more fun and visually striking.

There are some cringe moments, mainly at the start, but once the ball is rolling it reaches a satisfying conclusion. Far better than a majority of slop we receive on Netflix with dud ends.",4.5
"One of the greatest movies. I'm so glad Netflix made it didn't go to theaters. Hollywood thinks we are all rich and can afford $40-$80 outings to movies. They all want theatrical releases, but news flash: we broke. I need all movies straight to streaming. I could care less about theaters or that whole romantic idea of movie-going. Yeah, it was nice. But what is nicer? Streaming at home relaxed when I want to. ",5
This movie was very entertaining and made the two hours it lasted go by fast.,5
"Don't listen to the self-aggrandizing critics who clearly feel they can write better stories even though their written reviews are subpar at best. 
The movie was good, the ending message was good, it's not yet another hooker movie which is ""critic""ally-acclaimed... this is something you can enjoy.",5
"The beginning makes you think this actually looks pretty good, then you watch the rest of the movie and its just meh as hell.",1.5
"With an impressive cast, I was prepared to be electrified, but only experienced a lackluster spark.  Great visuals minus a weak script, equals an OK cinematic experience. ",3
"So, I've seen worse and seen better, but don't think it deserves all the hate its getting.  The CGI is fantastic, and although the story line was kind of weak, all in all its not a bad waste of 2 hours.  The only fact I can state is I believe this movie cements the fact that Millie Bobby Brown cannot carry a movie. ",2.5
"I really enjoyed the movie ! Fun family movie like the fun. Movies of the 80's ! A Definate Watch !!



",4.5
The Electric State is not the trainwreck that critics across the nation would make you believe. It‚Äôs certainly not groundbreaking or good either but rather in between. The Electric state is a reinvisioning the 90s of our world if we included robots/AI technology into our everyday lives. Now you heard this story before the machines rise up and the U.S. ends up kicking out the robots and putting them in their own area surrounded by a huge wall. Sound familiar? The Russo brothers seem to have a lot to say here but then again don‚Äôt really. In fact it‚Äôs surprising to see how sloppy they have become as filmmakers after making one of the best Avenger films ever. This movie overuses bad looking CGI throughout where it looks like you are watching a video game. Chris Pratt delivers the comedic performance while Millie Bobby Brown is more on the serious side. The movie has it‚Äôs fun parts but for the most part is very flat. Electric State gets a 2 star rating out of 5. ,2
I really enjoyed the film. It‚Äôs a fun movie and the special effects were great. It‚Äôs much better than most new streaming movies. Way better than these so called critic scores. ,3.5
"Critics panned this movie, and I was hesitant to watch it even though I‚Äôd been looking forward to its release. I am glad I didn‚Äôt listen to the critics. This is a great sci-fi movie. The special effects are amazing. The acting is strong. The storyline is engaging and relevant. It is worth your time to watch it!",4
I thought this was a great movie ! It was fun and light with great actors . Some good action and I loved HERM! A+ ,5
"Wow! So much hate out there. I really enjoyed Electric State. While it‚Äôs not quite the family friendly romp it‚Äôs billed to be, it‚Äôs still a good story, acted well and the effects are fantastic. Give it a shot, it‚Äôs worth it",5
Lazy uninspired misfire. The script should have never been approved. Impossible to believe the directors of End Game made this mess. Can‚Äôt even bother with a breakdown just avoid it at all costs so Netflix will get the message to stop spending so much money are garbage scripts. ,1
Love it fun Lil epric ,5
Don't believe the critics. I really enjoyed this movie. It was a lot of fun!,4.5
Incredible film with a touching message. Wonderfully executed and was engaging throughout.,5
I even don't know how to start... Boring... boring... Afrer 45 seconds you know how it ends... waste of time,0.5
"You like Robots? You willl love The Electric State! 

If you like robots, you will love this movie. If you are an overly critical person and enjoy finding flaws in art more than appreciating its beauty, then you should still like this movie‚Äîbecause it's practically flawless.

Adapted from Simon St√•lenhag‚Äôs haunting yet slightly whimsical book, The Electric State brings to life a world that‚Äôs both eerily desolate and unexpectedly tender. The film does an admirable job of filling in the narrative gaps left by the source material, providing a coherent and satisfying backstory for why society has crumbled the way it has. It doesn‚Äôt over-explain, but gives enough context to ground the viewer without stripping away the mystery.

The humor is well-timed and subtle, offering lightness without undermining the melancholy atmosphere. Most importantly, the robot-human relationships feel genuine, nuanced, and touching‚Äînever awkward or forced. There‚Äôs a fine line between charming and creepy when it comes to AI companions, and this movie nails it.

Visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and narratively sound, The Electric State is a rare example of a sci-fi adaptation that stays true to its artistic roots while making the story accessible and engaging for a wide audience.

Would you like me to make it shorter or give it a star rating too?

"Sh*ttiest movie ever made, the main character‚Äôs personality is messed up, action scenes are just trash, and many plot holes, 1/10",0.5
"Visually pretty, though very reminiscent of past productions such as ""tales from the loop"" and ""electric dreams"", entertaining enough with a fine cast including Stanley Tucci, Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt, who is very much being 'Chris Pratt' here, but I think it worked for the role. The problem lies in an insipid, vapid story line, by the beginning of the last act I was ready for it to end. If as much attention was given to the writing as was given to the production/CGI they could have had something great here.",3
"Look it's a 7/10 film, it's fun and it is has a heart. I have scored it an 8/10, this is just because the critics are souless husks and it doesn't deserve the low scores. ",4
"This is why I don't listen to movie critics, they just like to hear their own voices. I don't know the source material for The Electric State, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is great escapism for 2 hours. To me, that's all that's needed. I don't need deep meaning, perfect storyline, bold messages. Pure entertainment is what I sought and that's what I got. It was fun, visually stunning, and well acted. ",3.5

"The Electric State is the best demonstration of misappropriation and misinterpretation of source material I have ever witnessed. Hollywood and the streaming media machine strikes again, borderline offensively  turning Simon St√•lenhags dark and atmospheric apocalyptic cyberpunk horror thriller into this utterly pointless mess.

At the end of the day, it's perhaps my fault for having hope in the first place. The Russo brothers, the cast and the budget were all huge red flags. I should have set my expectations very, very low. Even then, I'd still have been shocked by this.

What an abysmal experience and a wasted opportunity. Would have loved for this I.P to have been placed in talented and respectable hands. And there's talk of the Russo's flogging this off as a TV show and a mobile game next....

All the fake positive audience reviews can't save it. 14% well deserved.

Absolutely disgusting (Sorry Simon).

"The Electric State is a $320 million t**d polished to a deceptive sheen, a textbook case of Netflix‚Äôs prestige-drama rot gone cinematic. Five minutes in, and you‚Äôre drowning in clich√©s so tired they‚Äôre practically fossilized: a smug kid aces an exam, Millie Bobby Brown storms in with teary-eyed platitudes about ‚Äúchanging the world,‚Äù and a robot T-shirt sparks the most ham-fisted conflict imaginable‚Äîall set to syrupy music that begs you to feel something for this hollowed-out husk. It‚Äôs a simulacrum of sci-fi, pillaging every IP from Terminator to Wall-E and leaving nothing but a steaming pile of recycled trash. Millie‚Äôs try-hard sincerity grates, the dialogue‚Äôs a vomit-inducing slog, and the budget only amplifies the sin‚Äîevery dollar screams wasted potential. This isn‚Äôt a film; it‚Äôs a cynical cash-grab for distracted scrollers, a superficial noise-fest that makes the world uglier. Turn it off before the stench sticks‚Äîfour minutes was enough.

"I dont get the hate, I actually enjoyed watching it. Kinda clich√© but not bad.",4.5
"The attraction to this film is the robots, but their novelty soon wears off and ultimately its less about them and once more about humans exploiting humans. the fact that you have technology far in advance of today's, with drones, neural networks, laser guns etc alongside 80s/90s technology doesn't work, the technology spreads around",2

Another example of where the ‚Äúcritics‚Äù got it so so wrong with their reviews.

"I don't know why this is getting so much hate. What were people expecting? I wanted a visually spectacular film, with outstanding vfx,  some laughs and action.

"I'm not sure that these ""professional"" critics are that professional, but seems like every movie that they put a negative spin on ends up the normal, everyday person likes.

The Electric State isn't ""Marvel Avengers"" good but it's not as bad as these professional claim.

It's got a story that's good, fun and easy to follow. It was great to see the concept of the 90s with technology beyond what was actually had and the cast is good!
It was good for a chilled night in.

It's made and aimed at young adults, so there's not going to be lots of violence, gore or bad language but just enough action to keep you watching.

I'm starting to watch the movies these critics have ""bombed"" because I think they've lost the plot more than the movies they're bagging out.",4

Well critics I don't know what film you were watching but it's wasn't this. Its a great fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. In the crazy world we are living in it's just what is needed to lift the mood. ,5
Critics have completely lost their touch. Film was a great and the 2 hours flew by. Highly recommend.,4
"This movie really only has three things going for it, a great cast of actors, a good premise, and amazing visuals. However the directing and the writing just aren't pulling their weight. The story tries to take on several topics while fleshing basically none of them out which is matched equally with how unfleshed out the characters are. There are SO MANY unearned moments with characters it is wild. The characters are also written flat and make it difficult to get attached to them, to the point where when the big dramatic music starts up and you're supposed to feel something for the loss of a character you just feel the obvious attempt of emotional manipulation, the movie screaming into your face ""You should feel sad now!"" Which that ends up being pointless anyway as (slight spoiler) every major character loss gets reversed, there is basically NO sacrifice.

What makes things worst though is the message, or rather messages they're rather clumsily but obviously trying to convey gets spelled out in a final narration at the end. It truly treats the audience like they're idiots. ""Here, you need to be sad now. Okay now this part, it's funny so you should laugh. Okay, now here's the whole moral of the story."" It's really unfortunate because I think they could have done something great with this premise but instead they just forced overused tropes and cringey one liners. The only good from this movie that I look forward to is the online critic reviews tearing it apart.",1.5
"Funny easy movie,great characters:)",5
"Critics are only there to destroy a film. There is no point in a critic anymore. Rotten tomatoes should be based on the audience score alone. It would make more sense. This film is very good, I enjoyed it a lot, the story, the actors are all amazing. All made possible by the amazing Russo brothers. Well done lads. ",5

Really enjoyed this movie. I have no idea why the critics hate it so much. Further proof that critics have lost touch as to what the general audience wants. ,5
"Great movie, lots of fun. Ignore the idiots trying to trash this film ",5
"I respectfully disagree with the critics consensus, I had a great fun time with this movie, it never felt long or bloated, the plot was not revolutionary but worked well and got me engaged till the end. The visuals were outstanding, the performances were good (I have a soft spot for Chris Pratt and this kind of child-man roles he's taken along his carrer, like Andy or Starlord) and I thought it was an overall good movie. You could even say there's a bit of social commentary on some of nowaday issues like megacorporations, unstable billionaires, addiction and socials taking up most of nowadays lives.  ",4
"There is no better sign that something corrupt is going on than a Critic rating of 15% and an Audience rating of 76%.  There is no way that this film merits such a low score. Sure, it isn't going to win Best Picture at the Oscars but it was entertaining, plus had some fun and funny moments. For anyone who genuinely likes the sci-fi or post apocalyptic genres, this is a half-decent movie that I for one can see myself watching again at some point. 

Time to figure out these review disparities as they seem to be getting worse. ",4
"It's puzzling to me why everyone hates this movie. I think this movie is great, funny and very entertaining. Millie and Chris Pratt together are entertaining to watch. The graphic design are amazing, I loves all the robots, and the alternate 90's they created. Watch this movie peeps, don't let your blind hate towards Millie or your premature criticism stop you. ",4
"Its decent, good graphics, okay story(sick of millie and chris) but overall an okay movie, i dont get what critics are smoking to give this a 15%. This is why critics nowadays have no respect/credibility.

Overall, 3 out of 5 for me.",3
"Sinceramente um filme espetacular, n sou nenhuma cr√≠tica especializada em fillmes mas j√° vi muita coisa nessa vida √© oque mais tenho visto √© que a ind√∫stria cinematogr√°fica tem pensado mais no que eles querem, no que eles acham certo, no que eles querem que agente aceite sem pensar . ja fazia um tempo que eu n assistia um filme t√£o tocante como the eletric state mostrando que a fam√≠lia √© estremamente importante mesmo com seus problemas e erros, e que a vida est√° aqui no fisico no cara a cara e n em telas e intelig√™ncias artificiais criadas pelo homem, que mostra que a mente humana √© mais poderosa que qualquer tecnologia, e que nada pode superar o contato humano, que se cerca da tecnologia √© ignorar a humanidade e um erro, que querer fazer as pessoas aceitarem oque vc quer sem pensar nelas e no que realmente √© correto n presta, e o filme mostro esatamente isso de uma forma ludica e divertida que vc nem v√™ o tempo passar ,e sinceramente n poderiam ter escolhido atores melhores pra mostrar essa verdade, ao meu ver a ind√∫stria cinematogr√°fica e esatamente igual ao vil√£o, fria calculista que s√≥ vai falar bem e apoiar aquilo que se enquadra nos padr√µes dela, ou aquilo que eles acham que n vai afetar tanto oque eles querem ,mas quando algo grande incrivel e controverso ao oque eles querem sae  n presta , e um desastre, perda de dinheiro ,tempo e quem se envolvel √© mediocri, eu s√≥ tenho uma coisa a dizer sobre isso eles tem medo da verdade ,pois a verdade liberta n precisamos do que eles falam que precisamos para ser feliz, sorrir dar uma risada, as vezes oque procuramos est√° mais perto do que imaginamos est√° do nosso lado mas a muito tempo n o vemos e n investimos nele ,e s√≥ ver oque eles tem elogiado e prestigiado nos √∫ltimos oscares assistam esse filme garanto que embora tenha uma hist√≥ria familiar simples n ser√° apenas os efeitos especiais ,a atua√ß√£o ou a trilha sonora que v√£o te imprecionar o filme e muito mais profundo do que parece e tem muito pra falar basta agente querer escutar ",5
"The Electric State is an absolutely mesmerizing film that combines stunning visuals, deep storytelling, and an unforgettable atmosphere. From the very first frame, you‚Äôre immediately drawn into this beautifully dystopian world. The film's CGI is mind-blowing, blending futuristic technology with a desolate, almost haunting landscape that feels both alien and familiar. What stands out most, for me personally, is the heart at the core of the story. Despite the grand scale of the world-building and the complexity of its technological concepts, The Electric State remains grounded in its emotional core.",5
"Finally something a little different, with comedy, action and a heart felt story line. Watched it once and watching it again with my kids tomorrow. ",5
"I don‚Äôt think the hate that this movie is getting is deserved. It‚Äôs not my favorite movie ever but I actually throughly enjoyed it. Has an all start cast, I didn‚Äôt even know Ke Huy Quan was in it and I‚Äôve loved his acting ever since my favorite movie the Goonies. He was great in Loki as well and amazing in this. 

I will say the movie is a bit out there and I‚Äôm not sure who its target audience is as it has crude humor. I‚Äôm 28 and enjoyed though. I like that it is an original idea of a movie where all the movies right now are regurgitated remakes and those are never as good as the first movies. So original movies right now are what we need. I would recommend honestly and I‚Äôll probably watch again sometime soon! ",4
It's just a real light hearted movie good watch ,5
"It's a tells us about real human connections. Heartwarming,  a must watch for everyone. More of this please Netflix !!!!!!",5
"You won't regret spending your time on this, it's not that bad as critics have called it. It's just doesn't match with it title that was promised.",3.5
"I think the critics were way too hard on the film.  The CGI really blew me away, but the story was surreal and had me engaged.  My friend referenced it to Toy Story and I'm partially with him on that.  I just really enjoyed it.",4
"The Electric State delivers a thrilling and heartwarming journey through an alternative, war-torn world that perfectly captures the essence of 1980s and 1990s family films. With Chris Pratt and Millie Bobby Brown leading a great cast that includes a personal favourite (Woody Harrelson as Mr Peanut), the movie weaves a delightful mix of humour, adventure, and nostalgic charm.

Set in an alternate, post-apocalyptic world where technology has dramatically altered society, the film brings the past into the future with its vivid, throwback aesthetic. The look and feel of the movie are strongly reminiscent of the beloved films from the 80s and 90s. It reminded my of a time when family movies had a perfect balance of goofy lighthearted adventure and underlying emotional depth with buckets of adventure poured on top. 

Millie Bobby Brown shines, with Chris Pratt providing the perfect balance of humour and heart as her gruff but caring companion. Their dynamic adds a sense of authenticity and warmth to the film, making their journey together a rollercoaster of both laughs and touching moments.  Their robotic companions never feel out of place, and add real charm to the movie. 

The humour in The Electric State is one of its strongest suits. The script is filled with clever quips and amusing interactions between characters, drawing on a light, family-friendly tone. It doesn‚Äôt shy away from moments of total absurdity, making it easy to see why this movie will resonate with audiences of all ages. The adventure is fast-paced, and kept us fully immersed while capturing that sense of fun and wonder that were found in classics like The Goonies or Batteries Not Included. 

In conclusion, The Electric State is a fun, visually stunning ride through a retro-futuristic world, with a perfect mix of humour, heart, and adventure. It's a throwback to the golden age of family films, and with a talented cast and a captivating story. It may not have a complex storyline, or make you think after the credits roll, but thats perfect for a film like this. 

On a more serious note, this is one of those movies that just hammers home how disconnected critics are from their supposed audience. Their job is to not what people want to see and to recommend, or not. Thats it, and the fact that they are so off the mark from audience scores just underlines how poor they are in knowing what people want, and how disconnected they are from movie fans.

Grab some popcorn, turn the brain down to 50% and just enjoy it!",4.5
"This movie stood at a great meh for me. The story made sense. Uniqueness was there however, I feel that this had oppression and real world relatable Ness going on due to current events. I don't really think things like this would happen though. It was definitely more like irobot and a mixture of other movies like The creator and finch. My Ratings (0-10 or NA) Emotions - 4 Uniqueness - 6 Script/Plot - 5 Relatability - 5  Acting - 5 Graphics/Realism - 6 Props - 4 Outfits - 4 Character Development - 4",3
"When you realise this film was directed by the same guys who directed TWS, CW and 2 of the highest grossing Avengers movies",3
"The critics got this one wrong‚Ä¶ as they so often do. I wish film reviewers would stop writing articles using the critic ratings as an indication of the quality of a film. When it really comes down to it, it‚Äôs the audience‚Äôs opinion that should matter most. 

This movie was great. The robots were so creative and enjoyable to watch. The film gave viewers a new perspective on what a sentient robot, cast out from human society, would go through to creative a new kind of community for themselves. 

It had plenty of action, just enough comedy, and was very heartfelt the whole way through imo. I was 100% engrossed from beginning to end, and that‚Äôs saying a lot with my ADHD. 

Rotten tomatoes should start putting the audience‚Äôs ratings first and foremost, we‚Äôre the ‚Äúreal‚Äù people whose opinion matters. Not some @sshat who gets paid to sit, watch, and usually sh*t on one of dozens of films they watch each week. 

Tl;dr: Watch it. You won‚Äôt regret it. ",5
"I regret every moment I wasted watching this movie. It's too late for me, but it's not too late for you. Just say no to this drivel.",0.5
I have no clue what these top critics watched. I watched a completely different movie. It was funny and touching and unique. Perfectly casted. This is the best Movie Netflix has given us in a very long time. I give it a 95% must watch. Once again the Top Critics are dead wrong,5
"   No definable target audience. It's not suitable for pre-teens, yet too simple for anyone else.
I guess maybe the same audience that's into pro wrestling? 
   Another Millie Bobby Brown vehicle that tries to cash in on her popularity while trashing her budding career in the process. 
   Miss Brown had better be very careful in her choice of roles for a while as the IMdB list she's been building is going to make her name synonymous with flops..",1.5
"yes we need this type of film, its been missing for awhile",4.5
"Loved the perfomance of Giancarlo Esposito( Gus Fring)  in the movie. Really adds a personal touch, altough his role could have been better. 

Also its really refreshing to see Chris Pratt do something other than show his palms to a literal dinosaur to make them calm down. 

The jokes in the movie were either repeated or a hit or miss. But other than that, the movie is pretty awesome. Its also funny to see the tomatometer plummet, but popcornmeter  is pretty good . Love to see the audience in action. 

Its a classic kids/action movie and you might not like it, but your kids are going to love it.",4
"All the negative critics must have a very sad life to get no joy out of a weird, retro-1990's robot movie starring Mr. Peanut! Trust the viewer reviews which are overwhelmingly positive! ",4.5
"Freakin awesome! Fallout and idiocracy had a baby... cool action, hilarious, super relevant story, and a great message. Love it",5
"This was a lot of fun... I'm not sure what the critics were looking for? I guess it cost a lot to make, but the effects are fantastic, it had a great cast, and the script was good enough. The whole family enjoyed it on a Saturday night!",4.5
"I really enjoyed this movie, it‚Äôs something refreshing. Definitely a must see!!",5
What. Great movie with an amazing message to unplug.,5
"I would say, it is an interesting movie.",5
"this film was fantastic. My only issue was that they kept it a bit surface and didn't dive too deep. it was clear they wanted to make sure as many people could watch as possible. That said, I understand the choice, and wasn't impacted by it in terms of enjoyment. It was very touching and endearing relationships abound. 

The thing that's really bothering me is, this clearly demonstrates that the industry is bough and paid for when it comes to critics because a 15% critic score verses a 75% audience score is just too big a gap to ignore. That's the most upsetting part of this film.",4
Sometimes you just need a big dumb movie to sit back and watch. Doesn't deserve all the bad reviews. ,5
The fan score of 75% is an accurate rating... 95% of critics shouldn't be trusted when it comes to movies. Most are out of touch with society and what the majority of people like. This was a cute and quirky movie with some good laughs and an awesome soundtrack. ,4
"‚ÄúThe Electric State‚Äù is a visually stunning cinematic journey that masterfully blends retro-futuristic aesthetics with heartfelt storytelling. Set in an alternate 1990s, the film follows Michelle, portrayed by Millie Bobby Brown, as she embarks on a quest to find her missing brother, accompanied by a charming robot companion. The Russo brothers‚Äô direction brings Simon St√•lenhag‚Äôs graphic novel to life, capturing the essence of a world where technology and humanity intertwine. Chris Pratt delivers a standout performance as Keats, adding depth and humor to the narrative. The film‚Äôs rich visual effects and evocative score by Alan Silvestri create an immersive experience that resonates emotionally, making ‚ÄúThe Electric State‚Äù a must-watch for science fiction enthusiasts and fans of compelling storytelling. Ôøº Ôøº Ôøº",5
" The one thing I kept asking myself during the movie was, ""Who is the target audience?"" Conceptually, it had the potential for a twisted, fun adult (R-rated) version. But the story was so basic in its telling, with a mostly failed attempt to be heartwarming, that I kept thinking maybe it‚Äôs aimed at 10 to 13-year-olds. If that‚Äôs the case, why bog it down with ""being a dick"" comments, middle fingers (the same joke could have worked with characters sticking out their tongues), and references to ""8 inches""? Plus, there was too much death and violence for a younger audience and not enough substance for an older one. So disappointing! I surprisingly found myself yearning for Transformers-level cringe when the dialogue only landed about half the time.

You know a movie has problems when you're still thinking, ""This has potential,"" 50 minutes in. People have commented on Millie Bobby Brown‚Äôs age and how she looks older now (because she is) - she looks great (reminds me of Alyssa Milano), but every bit a 20+ year old vs in High School, which throws the balance off even more. I kept hoping for an ET vibe but even the outcome felt hollow.

By the second half, I was working on my laptop because it didn‚Äôt really demand much attention. And when it ended, I just kept wondering; who exactly is this for?",2
"Great robot movie‚Ä¶watched it with my son we both loved it!!

So GLAD i didn‚Äôt listen to the critics!  Definitely took me back to my 90‚Äôs when everything was a whole lot better than these days‚Ä¶ Glad history does repeat üòúü©∑ü©∑ü©∑

I guess people are looking for trashy and this is definitely not.
",5
Whenever the critics rate a movie badly and the audience score is pretty good. You know the movie will be a good one. Critics are worthless. Was a solid watch with great CGI,5
"Electric State is a visually amazing movie with a cool mix of sci-fi and emotion, following a girl and her robot in a world that feels both eerie and beautiful. The story is a little slow at times, but the stunning scenery and heartfelt moments make it worth the watch.",5
I almost didn't watch this because of the critics. This was a great movie all around.  What do the critics even want? Is it possible to please these guys? ,5
"When it comes to films, there are times when a star-studded cast and acclaimed directors simply can‚Äôt salvage a lackluster screenplay. ‚ÄúThe Electric State‚Äù is a perfect example of this disappointment. Despite the talent involved, the film felt empty and all too familiar, like we were watching a lesser version of previous Russo Brothers productions. It‚Äôs becoming all too common for Netflix to churn out action flicks in the same way Hallmark does with rom-coms‚Äîquantity seems to take precedence over quality and inspiration.

The film tries to stuff what feels like a trilogy's worth of material into a mere two hours, which is a recipe for disaster. A longer format, like a trilogy or mini-series, might have given the story the chance to develop properly, instead of rushing through pivotal moments with hasty exposition. We need the emotional groundwork laid before the big moments hit; otherwise, they feel forced and unearned.

What‚Äôs truly disappointing is that the trailer had me hooked. The premise was promising and relevant, and some of my favorite actors were on board. But if Stanley Tucci can‚Äôt rescue a film, you know it‚Äôs in trouble. Chris Pratt‚Äôs performance felt disappointingly flat and uninspired, while Millie Bobby Brown, despite her talent, couldn‚Äôt quite bring the emotional depth that the role demanded. Everything felt bland and contrived‚Äîno spark, no life. Even with a cast full of stars, this movie struggled to find its footing.

Visually, the CGI and robot designs were impressive, but it seemed like the Russo Brothers were banking on that alone to recreate the epic scope of ""Avengers: Endgame"" without establishing any real emotional stakes.

At this point, I‚Äôm eager to see the Russo Brothers create something truly compelling outside the Marvel universe. If they continue down this path, they might find themselves out of the directing game by 2030. Check it out for yourself, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that this was a massive swing and a miss.",2.5
Our family really loved this lighthearted movie. Thanks to Netflix. ,5
"Wow!  A rare polished coming together of many factors:
- A strong contemporary pro-human theme,
- The snappy pacing of a comic book robot story,
- Moments of quiet, sincere character building,
- Robots who come to life, as well as it has even been done,
- A third act that ""sticks the landing.""
Not to mention the to-die-for VFX and practical effects work.  End-to-end the film is narratively coherent with no late-2nd-act slowdown.  
I again attribute the expertise demonstrated here as the result of multiple technical directors (visual story telling experts) from previs, and several of the top VFX-CGI houses all collaborating to tell and sell the best story possible. 
Not to be missed if you ever liked a big budget successful 1990s popcorn movie or 2010s  super hero movie.  
So why all the hate from critics?  All the early hate is probably why it wasn't released in theaters.  
Let's go thru the reasons again.  We live in  a time where Frump and blatant cruel brutality rules.  What chance does a movie whose theme is uplifting humanity's need for freedom and personal connection?  What room is there for a movie which approaches these themes thru the surprising, and unpredictable lens of a robot comic book?  I suspect even the bro reviewers who like the Russo's Avengers Endgame movies (catnip for bros) will dislike Electric State.

"Now I‚Äôm worried for the future of the MCU. The budget for this pile of poop, was $320 million!!!!!!! I hear the budget for Avengers: Doomsday is around $400 million if not more!! I have zero faith now! Endgame was the true finale of the MCU, and the finale of the Russo Brothers careers. ",1.5
Not the most original story. But the world building and visual effects are pretty good. This would make fun family viewing for movie night.,3.5
"I really wanted to like this movie and prove the professional critics wrong but as I write this the ending credits are rolling and I am left to wonder why Netflix wasted an enormous bunch of money on this disaster of a flic.?
No you will not get your time back and no you will not be able to unhear the unbearable dialogue.
I guess Netflix has these  B- list actors under a contract they can't decline matter how dreadful the idea is.
It's getting to the point where the content is spewed out but the quality is severely lacking and playing scrabble with a friend is a much better way to spend a Saturday night.
This movie left me wondering what the money could have been better  put to use doing...water project to the third world, saving the rainforest, etc etc.
Wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on this is unacceptable on many levels.
Skip it and thank me later.",1
"It's just devoid of anything memorable, hard to blame anyone but Netflix with the cash and weight they are throwing around. So I blame them.",2
"If you know nothing of the source material and just stumbled upon it on Netflix it's a cute story. Pacing is a bit off, but I really enjoyed it. Alternative 1990s was wild! And a good soundtrack to boot!",5
"Wanted to like it. Great visuals, but everything else was terrible. Milly's super heavy makeup just creeps me out; Chris Pratt was not funny, which is unusual. It's so weird how what was good visually was so bad in just being fundamentally entertaining.",0.5
I found this movie simple but very entertaining,4
"This is a fun movie, yes, some cheesy, some predictable, but overall was a weird twisted reality world with lots of different characters with unique personalities. ",5
"While not the greatest movie ever, the critical reviews feel heavy handed here. This movie was visually arresting, had great actors, and a solid script with decent pacing. It was funny, and had a vibe that matched my experience of the book decently enough. The film had enough emotional depth to pull at the heart strings. I think this film will have a cult following years from now if Netflix has the discipline not to delete it from the interwebs. ",4
"Unfairly critic rated film... If enjoy 80s and 90s adventure blockbusters like ET, Total Recall and the Goonies, you ll recognise the narrative formula used, and love the film for it. ",5
It's cheesy and shallow af but it's worth the watch. It got me a few times. But I was pretty drunk while watching lol,2.5
A super fun ride. Really loved this movie especially seeing this is not a lot of good ones out there at the moment. Good fun for the whole family too.,4
"A lot of people are really dissing on this movie and I want to share my contrasted opinion.
As an older sister with a younger brother, this movie really touched my heart and had me bawling during the Christmas flashback scene. I think it accurately represented how deep sibling love can go, and the challenges of change and struggling to hold on to a sibling during life events. I think the real message was reflective of how you have to eventually let people go, no matter how much you need them in your life, which is an especially powerful message, as I‚Äôm soon going off to college. I can‚Äôt imagine not seeing my little brother for more than a month. In my opinion, this movie was really well done, and I don‚Äôt care if it was ‚Äúrecycled‚Äù or whatever the critics are saying. Anyway, just my opinion!",4.5
Fun movie without an agenda. So refreshing. The animation is great as are the cast. Worth a watch!,5
"It's just sheer, popcorn family fun. Chris Pratt and Millie Bobbie Brown clearly enjoying themselves, along with a ""cast"" of robots who feel like they have more soul than most Oscar-winning actors. Is it a masterpiece? No way. Is it riddled with inconsistencies that would aggravate your typical neurodivergent film critic? Absolutely. But it's based on the desire to find family, form platonic friendships, and deal with the family trauma of loss and belonging in the package of a live-action cartoon.",4.5
"Despite this film's negative reviews, I was completely unaware it was based on a graphic novel. It is important to note when it comes to the rights to works of art, whether it be comic books or stories, you must refrain from trying to merge the two, as they will never be ultimately the same shot for shot, word for word. We have seen this with many reiterations that have strayed from the beaten path of the written word, The Last of Us comes to mind when I think about how for most of the television series goes shot for shot, it does stray from the source material to give the viewer a little more sustenance to hold their attention despite failing to do that throughout the first season, and especially during some significant intense portions of the game they decided to withhold from the live action rendition. 
The Electric State is a fantastic movie that never bored me. I enjoyed the plot and the acting, as well as the beautifully executed visual effects. As I sit here purchasing the graphic novel from Amazon, I'm sure my opinion will differ once I read it and see how it compares to the film. I recognize significant differences between the artist's vision and what Hollywood produces. Overall, this movie was enjoyable and presented the premise of what the world became after the war‚Äîpeople, much like today's real world, are so glued to the internet that it consumes every aspect of their lives. Our interactions can only be described as inconsequential, as there is no control over who operates online or what sensational topics, they stir up to create controversy.  
This film was eye-opening, but it was definitely the type of film you watch together with friends and family, sit back and enjoy. I can‚Äôt recommend it enough.

"This was a fun, visually stunning popcorn film. Not sure why the critics dislike it so much. Movies can exist for entertainment, they're not all going be Citizen Kane, and that's okay. ",4
These critics need new jobs. ,3.5
Definitely a worthwhile watch!,3.5
"Fun watch that's an allegory to current times, and even historical times. Great CGI, good story, and great acting. People's rights, based on a piece of paper? Freedom at any cost? A group marginalized and forced into living less than? Sounds eerily familiar. It's obvious the message either went over critics head's, or they refuse to see it because they're stuck in the cult echo chamber, giving it ridiculously bad reviews while it's somehow #1 in the streaming platform. The critics 'reviews' are dull and derivative. Sounds like they used AI to generate their reviews, how comical. Ignore the stupid critics and reviews from painfully obvious, politically biased newspaper and mainstream media, watch it for yourself and decide.",5

The movie really was great.  Unfairly reviewed by critics.,5
"This movie is nostalgia and current all at the same time. When we have someone we can't control, we feel threatened and become defensive. Let's get rid of them. Remove them.

The characters are mostly likeable, the CGI is OK, and the action comes at a steady pace.  Citizen Kane it ain't, but it doesn't insult the intelligence of its intended tween audience.",2.5
"Just further proof that critics are completely out of touch... was the movie a little slow at some points? Yes... did it feel like the actors ""phoned it in"" as the critics say? Absolutely not... this was a nostalgia movie, with tons of 90's Easter Eggs for those watching closely. The acting was decent, and the plot made a lot more sense than the critics gave it credit for. My only real complaint was the pacing, which felt at times like it was moving too slow.

Bottom line - is it the best movie you'll ever see? Nope... But it is worth a watch, particularly if you grew up in the 90s.",4
This movie was honestly amazing I dont get why this has 15 rotten tomatoes I really like this movie!,5
"Watched it over movie night not expecting much. It had a slightly jarring exposition dump, but it established the world well. First thing we noticed was WOW the cinematography; it lingers on all the right moments, beautiful lighting, the works. Someone really loved the 90s because my god, the retrofuturistic environments. I've never seen a movie with such seamless cgi, we totally thought it'd be a hyperreal Freddy Fazbear situation, but somehow you forget the pure absurdity of robot Mr. Peanut in serious camera shots. Cowabummer. I was indifferent to the main humans for a while, I think was the weakest element. They grew on me though. But honestly, I just love every bot in this movie and was praying they wouldn't die. They might kill your favorite guy. Sorry.

I was so surprised seeing that critics shredded it before release for being shiny corporate slop. It's a fun and weirdly emotional adventure. The final battle was epic. See it in theatres if you can. We're definitely checking out the book after this!",4.5
"The plot had promise but was ambushed by a very corny ( freaky) version of robots in a parallel world. 
But that aside, Millie Bobby Brown sleepwalked her way through the movie with amazingly sub par acting w the exception of her ( pre war) character.
Pratt did what he does and single handedly kept the movie from being complete garbage.
",2
"Cute movie, lots of 90s nostalgia. Suppose to remind people to turn off the phones and go live their life. Mille and Pratt were awesome just like everything else they are in. The effects of using the most advanced cgi to create old school slow moving rough robots actually worked beautifully. Not the greatest movie ever made but compared to a lot of Netflix movies lately was very good.",4.5
"The critics are self absorbed and out of touch with real people. They think their opinion is something worth valuing, which is far from the truth. Loved this movie. The actors and voice actors were great. The end of the movie made me question what I would be capable of in times of crisis and need. Family friendly, some laughs, some tears, some reflection, and some heart. Everything a movie should be. ",5
"Another great example on how the critics don't know what good movies are. I will continue not to care about their opinion.  Movie was great! Good humor,  good storyline, action was fun. Overall fun movie to watch with the family.  Best movie of 2025 so far ",5
Loved the movie. The human vs robot aspect and person vs person made it every interesting and engaging. It's about love and strong bonds.,5
"Despite less than favorable critical reviews, I found The Electric State to not be a ‚Äúbad‚Äù movie. Actually, it‚Äôs a rather good movie with plenty of heart and lovable characters‚Äîeven if they are robots. Millie Bobbie Brown does a serviceable job in the lead role, but this is hardly her take on the energetic Enola Holmes or the superpowered Eleven. Chris Pratt is delightfully miscast in his role, as he brings a lot of energy and humor to the film, even if he feels a little too wholesome for his character. The production design and effects are wonderful and full of vibrant robot characters and dystopian landscapes. It doesn‚Äôt reach the heights of Spielberg‚Äôs marvelous Ready Player One, but for folks looking for a family-friendly dystopian adventure, look no further than The Electric State. ",3.5
"Not the drudge or failure the critics are saying it is. Not even close. The Russo brothers have created a film with heart. Yes, it gets a little sappy at times but overall the message is beautiful. 

The sets are beautifully made. A kids movie? Kind of. But if you're an adult with a kid's heart, you'll like it. 

Despite the critical reception, it's worth noting that Netflix has a history of turning critically panned movies into streaming hits, as seen with titles like Red Notice and Back in Action. Therefore, The Electric State could and probably will still achieve significant viewership numbers on the platform. ",4
"What truly makes The Electric State stand out is its ability to be both fun and deeply thought-provoking. Beneath the action and humor, the movie raises questions about humanity‚Äôs reliance on technology, the meaning of connection, and what it truly means to be free. It doesn‚Äôt preach but rather leaves room for interpretation, making it a great conversation starter for a new generation of movie lovers.

Unlike many modern blockbusters that feel formulaic, this film feels refreshing. The pacing is tight, the action sequences are thrilling, and the emotional beats land without feeling forced. It keeps you entertained while offering a story that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll.

Overall, The Electric State is an impressive, well-crafted film that delivers on multiple levels. It‚Äôs entertaining, funny, visually captivating, and layered with meaning. Whether you‚Äôre a longtime sci-fi fan or new to the genre, this one is definitely worth the watch.",5
"This movie was really good! There is definitely a lot of derivative stuff in this one but it's a ton of fun with great themes& messaging. It's heartfelt, well acted, and stands out with it's humor and nuanced take on our relationship to technology ",5
"Only watched to see how bad a movie could get, having received 13% on Rotten Tomatoes tomatometer.

Rotten Tomatoes ‚Äúprofessional film critics‚Äù missed badly. This might be one of the top 100 movies of all time. Crying laughing many times, smiling throughout. Chris Pratt‚Äôs best work. Released 6 months later and its in contention for an Oscar for best sound. There is fun, heart, adventure, creativity that is not vain, rewatchability, Easter eggs galore, an over-performing cast, excellent comedic timing and production.

This will become a cult classic such as Beetlejuice, Office Space, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The Goonies, Napoleon Dynamite, Edward Scissorhands, and MST3K.

This is one of those very rare and special movies that gets way better the fifth time you watch it than it was the first three times. Since it came out yesterday, people just don‚Äôt know it yet ;)",5
Critics are idiots - watched with my kids - they absolutely loved it. I did too.,5
"This film looks amazing, top-tier CGI, with cool & fun robot designs. Tucci‚Äôs villain was fine, some apathetic tech dude who lacked any real edge. Although i enjoyed the film, it defo felt like just another dystopian flick, but with all the dark & grittiness smoothed off. The main duo‚Äôs dynamic didn‚Äôt seem to evolve much, & I‚Äôm pretty sure I cared about Keets & Herm's journey more than what was going on with the siblings‚Äô. I also never really felt the stakes for either side or connected with any the characters, robot or human. I'm not sure if we didn't get to spend enough time with the characters or maybe the pacing was a little fast/compressed, but it defo made some moments less impactful. Overall, it‚Äôs a fun watch, i enjoyed it, but not what i was hoping for.",3.5
"Critics got this wrong! This movie has so much heart, humor and pretty close to perfect. I don‚Äôt know what kool aid the critics drank, but this movie deserved better. The effects were good and, honestly, better than some of the big blockbusters Hollywood has been sloppily putting out lately. Loved it, cried, laughed and would watch it again. ",3.5
Totally enjoyed it. Critics suck. This movie was fun.,5
"Both formulaic but fresh at the same time. While it doesn‚Äôt break any new ground, it‚Äôs still perfectly enjoyable to watch, and probably warm enough for rewatches.",4.5
"I thought it was a pretty good movie. I think the critics are being a little too harsh on this one. Pratt is great, Mackey voiced his bot well, Millie did well, everyone did a fine job. The CGI is top shelf. I want to see it again. ",5
"It's really uncanny to see all these negative reviews from top critics while we have so many positive reviews from popular audience.. I wonder if the negative opinioners really understand what makes a good movie because after watching this one I honestly don't see why it would be so bad ?.. It's not the first time such reviews discrepancy happens, like these alleged experts don't give objective evaluations but rather answer a request of manipulating potential audience.. Who's behind it ? And why do they keep posting fake opinions ? No idea, but for sure keeping this up eventually makes this website a mere scam..

This movie was great, funny, entertaining, with good acting, a nice atmosphere and a very nice story, don't trust the ""experts"".",4
"To quote Hemingway ‚ÄúCritics are men who sit and watch a battle from a high place and come down to shoot the survivors."" Personally I think this movie was pretty good. I recommend you watch it. Decide for yourself. ",5
The critics are clueless on this one. Lots of heart and it's mind in the right place. ,5
"Look, if there‚Äôs one thing I know for sure, it‚Äôs that critics are almost always wrong. Seriously. 9 out of 10 times, their reviews don‚Äôt match up with how a movie actually makes you feel. I totally believe the critics don't even watch the majority of movies they review, they just copy the last critics review and make up the rest. No individual review really matters when it comes to whether you are going to enjoy the movie. 

This is exactly why watching a movie is based on the vibe you want to leave with. Do you want to feel hopeful? Inspired? Maybe a little tearful or exhilarated? That‚Äôs the feeling you should be chasing. For example, if you‚Äôre looking for something that‚Äôll leave you feeling energized and uplifted, this movie delivers. 

So, forget about what the critics say‚Äîtrust yourself and what you want to feel when the movie‚Äôs over. If you want a bit of a pick-me-up, maybe give this one a go. The joy is in the movie experience. Great job by the actors! I found this a fun and entertaining movie, so few movies are being made like Electric State, original and fresh. Well done!",5
Wow.... I thought this would be a great watch. Wow was I wrong üòï.  Chris Pratt... once was good. ,0.5
"I understand why critics didn't like this movie but for your average movie watcher it's a fun movie to just sit back & relax with a big bowl of Popcorn and enjoy the movie without complexity. It's a great popcorn movie to watch with friends and family or even by yourself!

It's not a deep, thought provoking movie but the movie does carry an emotional punch. 

Don't focus on the Critics Reviews and just enjoy watching this entertaining movie. It's a Fun movie with cool characters (be as it may they're not human) with some beautiful and creative scenery.

Give it a chance and enjoy this movie on that rainy day when you've watched everything else and looking for something new.",4
A fun watch a great stroy millie bobby brown and chris pratt were fantastic ,4.5
"I really don‚Äôt understand why this movie has so many haters. The dialogue is a little cheesy and generic at times, and the plot does play out a bit predictably- yes. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a groundbreaking or award winning film.

 However, it was entertaining, fun, and even pulled on my heart strings a bit. The characters are very likable and have a lot of personality. They‚Äôre easy to connect to and root for. Great acting and casting all around. (P.S to all the people saying Millie Bobby Brown is to ‚Äúold‚Äù to play a teenager, check yourselves- the actress is only 21! Y‚Äôall are trippin.) 

 The ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù of the film was a bit one dimensional, though I did appreciate the scene with his mother and his argument for the neurocasters providing peace. On that note, It does seem like there‚Äôs a lot of big ideas that the film sort of glosses over relating to this- (AI, consciousness, what makes one alive and the humanity of humans vs the ‚Äòhumanity‚Äô of machines) and that does feel like a bit of a missed opportunity to add some depth and intellectual fodder to chew on.  

I have not read the book, so I can‚Äôt comment on how well the movie represents it. 

Overall, I found the film to be an engaging and enjoyable watch that left me with a positive and inspired feeling. And that‚Äôs pretty good in my opinion. ",4
"The critics got it wrong with this one. The Electric State is a visually stunning, emotionally gripping adventure that deserves way more love than it‚Äôs getting. The cast is phenomenal‚Äîevery actor fully embodies their role, bringing depth and heart to this unique, immersive world. The story masterfully balances action, humor, and emotional weight, keeping you hooked from start to finish. The direction is top-notch, with breathtaking cinematography and a world that feels both grand and intimate.

This is the kind of film that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll. It‚Äôs bold, different, and full of heart‚Äîa rare gem in today‚Äôs blockbuster landscape. Don‚Äôt let the critic hate sway you. Think for yourself, give it a shot, and you might just thank yourself later.",5
"The Electric State delivers a visually stunning and engaging experience, blending a lighthearted and relaxed atmosphere with well-timed humor. The direction masterfully balances adventure and emotion, creating a story that flows naturally without excess or pacing issues.",5
I fell asleep. I grew up in the 80's which is why I love sci-fi and shows like Stranger Things... The Electric State is in the 90's which I still grew up in but I found The Electric State quite boring. It's hilarious how they modeled Stanley Tucci to look exactly like Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. The 80's music was great though. It makes you wonder how studios are able to waste so much money when everyday items like groceries are so expensive nowdays... There is absolutely no way that the studio makes their $320M back from making this movie. ,2
Great entertainment. Only message... Get outside and connect with others. Visuals are spot on from the novel.,5
"This film is actually pretty good! Maybe not the absolute best thing to come from the Russo brothers, but definitely an enjoyable, and at times powerful film! It has its downsides for sure. It's fairly predictable and has some odd pacing. But visually, it's impressive! And while not my favorite score of all time, Alan Silvestri definitely made an enjoyable and fitting track. While far from perfect, if you're intrigued, give it a watch! ",3.5
"It's quintessential Netflix - somewhat trite and predictable, but it's hard not to find some enjoyment in it. I do think we've reached the age where Millie Bobby Brown is not a believable teen and she had to struggle through some not good scripting, but she pulled through. Nearly all supporting cast - meat or metal, as they say - were great. Chris Pratt was the same person he is in everything. A solid ""let's watch a movie tonight"" popcorn flick that won't change your life, but will entertain you.",3.5
"does not replicate the eerie atmosphere of the source material, just took some of the robots then called it a day. ",0.5
"At first I was enamored with the world. I absolutely love that aspect of the film.

But everything else about this movie is terrible. Despite being PG-13, the plot seems like it's aimed at children under 10. The acting and casting is atrocious. While the actors themselves aren't bad, they definitely phoned this movie in. Also, this is the first movie since Milly Bobby Brown got plastic surgery to make herself look 42 even though she's only 21, which probably wouldn't matter but she's supposed to be playing a high school kid in this movie.

Everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong.",1
My wife and I loved it. Funny and lots of fun.,5
"The critics need to calm down! This movie was very enjoyable, sure the concept has been done before and some of the details weren't explained properly. But this movie is still great! 

The casting was also good. I've seen some critics complain about Millie Bobby Brown's  presence in this film, and even questioned her as an actress... And that's where I draw the line. She is remarkable and she really gave it her all. 

I do think the blonde they chose for this movie washes her out and ages her a bit, which made Chris Pratt calling her kid a bit weird. If they wanted to change it up they could've done something similar to what she was rocking at the Stranger Things season 4 premiere or even something like she had in Damsel. 
But that's really my only note!",4
"$320 million for a film stripped of emotion and devoid of surprises, where CGI overshadows character depth, and plot holes yawn like chasms beneath the weight of a dull, predictable script. A colossal spectacle that prioritizes visual grandeur over genuine human connection. Even the popcorn tastes bad with this movie.",0.5
"I don't normally leave reviews or comments on films watched however I feel I must now.

This film is great, reminded me a little of Ready player one and A.I.
The films message is comes over well and the no expense spared on the CGI is very evident.
Overall a stunning look into a possible Future.
Definitely will be watching this again with the family.",5
"Really enjoyed it, great performance from Millie Bobby brown, and adore Christopher the robot! 
CGI was epic! Highly recommend",4.5
Fun movie.  It doesn‚Äôt deserve all the hate from the critics ,5
This was a good movie. Critics need to be reviewed. It was enjoyable and a great story. ,5
"Terrible! This movie was bad. Chris Pratt calling Millie Bobby ‚ÄúKid‚Äù was cringe because she looks like she is her 30s! She is not that great of an actress. The robots did look real! Good animation, that‚Äôs about it. ",1
It was entertaining.  I have seen a lot worse streaming service movies.,4
"Thought this was a super cool and cute movie with nice messaging about human connection along with future issues with AI. It‚Äôs like a mashup of Ready Player One, District 9 and WALL-E, good for older kids with cool 90s references that a family can enjoy, little moments of sadness and jokes ",4.5
Loved it. A great popcorn movie. I wish we could have seen it in the theater.,5
Very good movie don‚Äôt listen the haters ,5
"Is it the best movie in the world? No. Is it watchable? Yes. I enjoyed the premise (the future but in the 1990s), a real star-studded cast and robots who were real characters with real personalities and real emotions. I wasn't bored for a minute, which is a lot more than I can say for other recent films that have put me to sleep. I can even imagine a sequel‚Ä¶",3.5
"Lol, critics didn‚Äôt ‚Äúrate it at 15%.‚Äù That‚Äôs not how aggregate scores work, people‚Ä¶

It just means that 15% of people who actually watch and comprehend movies as a profession really likes the stupid movies that you typically watch and enjoy while messing around on your phone.

The fact that anyone is talking about other people being ‚Äúbrainless‚Äù while celebrating *this* bad of a movie is a good example of how the dumbest people in society are actually so stupid that they think they‚Äôve achieved genius‚Ä¶

Those are the people upset that a professional critic didn‚Äôt pop one in their sweatpants over this crap.",1
"I am an avid sci-fi lover, if you embrace the fact that this was meant to be fun, likely predictable, enjoyable for a variety of audiences, especially including those that are not sci-fi lovers, then this was on target and very enjoyable. I would recommend it. 

I don't quite understand the harsh reviews have been hearing. Think a little bit of Mars Attacks, and independence Day.  No one thought this was going to be interstellar, 2001, The Matrix, etc. 

Was thoughtfully executed. Considering the niche is trying to fill as a comical family-oriented sci-fi, it was very much on point. The CGI was pretty great. 

My wife is tolerant of my love of sci-fi, military movies etc, she enjoyed this. 

Give it a shot with the family, enjoy a weekend or evening couple of hours of lighthearted entertainment. ",4
"Bom, eu assisti ao filme. Achei ele bem interessante, mas achei que o roteiro se perdia em algumas partes e n√£o fazia muito sentido. Tirando isso, um filme engra√ßado que vale a pena assistir. ",3.5
I don't understand the bad reviews at all. This was a good movie with great music (including Danzig and Judas Priest) with a clear human message and outstanding actors.,4
"If you're watching this without any knowledge of the source material, you would probably enjoy it. It's a great movie to watch with the family and turn your brain off for a couple of hours. But as a fan of Simon Stalenhag, this is a waste of his work. Yet another cut and paste blockbuster movies with big names, a shallow plot, and cool visuals. ",1.5
"I don't get all the negative critic reviews. Is it brilliant? No. Is it entertaining enough to keep with it, yes. Story is pretty predictable but visually it's quite impressive. Not many films have such an original story it remains with you for years, this isn't that, but should it be rated at 15%? No. 60% is closer to the reality ",3.5
"Fantastic movie. Brainless critics didn't like it because it wasn't about people talking to each other for 180 minutes. It was funny, well written and had fantastic visuals. 100% worth a watch. ",5
"An amazing and beautiful film. Fun and entertaining.  I have nothing bad to say about it, is just this good.",5
Ridiculously bad. Only time I‚Äôve watched a Chris Pratt film and didn‚Äôt enjoy it. Netflix films just continue to get worse and worse ,1
"I honestly enjoyed The Electric State from start to finish, it had it's funny parts and some serious parts as well as some suspense. I'd watch it more then once for sure. For anyone who hasn't watched I recommend you give it a chance. <3

"Great film, a little bit cheesy in places but we enjoyed it. ",4.5
The potential for a good film was there but it was crippled by a weak dialog and horrible acting.,1
"I dont get the hate this is getting. Viasually beautiful, good music and a light hearted story. I loved it.",5
"Not a blockbuster, but I enjoyed this movie very much. We've learned till now that critics are a bunch of morons, they provide no value and their opinion is garbage. Grab some popcorn and enjoy the ride.",5
"Was a great,fun and funny movie. And the 90s throw backs added to it. Worth the watch for sure.",5
"Just the sort of movie to sit down with the kids 10-14. We all enjoyed it. 90s retro for the dad, cool robots for the 10 year old boy. Nice feel good story for the 12 year old girl and interesting discussion about the ethics of life support and what value of life is all about for the 14 year old. I recommend it and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt see all the negative critical reviews first as I might not have chosen to watch",4

I loved this movie.  Ignore the critics.  If you're a scifi fan you will love it.  I didn't read the book, and maybe that's why I don't find fault with it.",5
"I thought it was a brilliant movie, good comedy, great story with a good message..... Rotton tomato movie critics are so boring and negative, can never rely on there opinion nowadays üò¥ ",5
"It was great idea, and the major plot points had good pacing, the visuals were great, and the action was well placed, if at times a little boring and disjointed. This movie had a lot of potential to be one of the greats and was pretty close, but overall it fell flat at every turn. The main issue with this story is it lacked heart. The entire time I felt like I was watching the movie behind a glass, comfortably removed from the struggles the society and characters were facing. I love Millie and Pratt individually, but together their chemistry was nonexistent (likely not due to them, but due to the writing). Additionally, it seemed like with every line delivery, each of them had no idea who their character was supposed to be, which was no fault of theirs because it seemed like the writer had no idea either. Overall, the characters felt like an afterthought and the world building was flat. This film really shows you that in an action film, the most important scenes, the ones that make or break it, aren't the dramatic climaxes or the flashy fights, but the quiet calm moments in between, where the spirit of the characters, the world, and the writer are supposed to come through and consume the viewer. In these pivotal moments, the movie felt recycled, apathetic, and underdeveloped. This movie feels like it was written by a talented yet amateur writer. All that being said, it was very close to being a great film, and I enjoyed it.",3
"Bro yall hating for no reason. Sure it had issues, but its a really fun watch, the cast is great, love the plot, its a nice film",5
"I almost always watch movies now without looking at reviews first. Tbh i feel reviews spoil the movie even if there are no actual spoilers. I can tell in the fist few scenes if I'm going to watch it or not. After watching, i saw some reviews and felt i shoud write one because they really trashed this movie and tbh it's not a bad movie. Yes it's an obvious storyline and there are basically no twists or turns but it's fun  to watch and the acting is good. 

To be critical of it the flaws are, the story is clich√© and flat, the pacing is a bit off in the middle and the time continuity is very off in places. Also it's a bit overly mushy for me at the end. 

The world building is good, the graphics are good the acting is good. Just needed that little extra something in the story but its a decent film for netflix. ",3.5
"I really enjoyed this film. It's fun and fresh. Nothing like it. Ignore the ""expert critics"", like the mainstream media, they are way out of touch. ",4.5
"It had some potential from the cast to the robot plot, but it was just kind of boring and they just seemed to rush things really fast, I don‚Äôt know if this was just me, but an example was in the very beginning where 5 minutes in they introduced the robot and then they just kind of assumed that everyone knew that it was the brother, even though they never explained how we got that conclusion.
4/10",2
I think the critics need to lighten up and learn to enjoy some old fashion and action that this movie actually delivers.,5
"Critics reviewing The Electric State are like GPS systems from the early 2000s‚Äîloud, confident, and completely lost. They tell you it's a wreck, but meanwhile, audiences are out here actually enjoying the ride. Maybe next time, they should review their own relevance instead!

IWith stunning visuals, heartfelt storytelling, and rich world-building, The Electric State is an unforgettable journey. The bond between human and robot characters like Kid Cosmo and Herman adds real heart, making the film both thrilling and deeply moving. A must-watch for sci-fi fans.
",5
I have no idea why the critics dislike this movie so much. It is a good movie.,4
"Not sure why it‚Äôs rated low, great film ",5
"Im not quite sure what all these people expected. Its like omg this isn't a sure in for all the Oscar's so it awful.

It's a fun movie you can watch with the family. It has some really funny parts and great action scenes. 
The beginning 20 minutes or so is too slow and should've been cut honestly. They went in too much with the brother stuff. We all get it brothers and sisters are close. We don't need 20 minutes of just them doing regular stuff. 
Outside of that the movie was awesome. Ive watched it 3 times already. The story isn't great and millie bobby brown characters is very bratty and annoying. Very stuck up for being an orphan. Everyone else is top tier in my book. Chris Pratt is very funny like he always is. His bot sidekick had me laughing almost everytime he spoke. 
It has a fallout feel to it. Scrappy bots in the desert. Overall this was great and don't listen to the stuck up critics on this one. Don't go in expecting the best movie you've ever seen and you'll have a good time. Great family movie. My 2 year old was loving the robots. If you have Netflix and an free evening watch it. ",4.5
Turned it on. Annnnnnnd then off. Critics got this one right. ,1.5
"I enjoyed it a lot and will probably watch it again. Maybe I‚Äôm out of touch.  I can‚Äôt believe how much the critics hated it.  It‚Äôs almost as if all the critics piled on.  I think I‚Äôm more in line with the audience score. I grew up in the 90s and I think the movie dug out all the right emotions from that era.  You can tell the team worked really hard on the film. Plus, it was a fun movie to watch, it‚Äôs entertainment people! It‚Äôs not supposed to be life changing!  If you want that, take a hint from the movie and unplug, go do something for your community, I don‚Äôt know go plant a tree! ",5
"Thoroughly enjoyed this. Great cast, story and loved how it was put together. Nostalgic, fresh & plenty of action and clever quips. Well done Russo's, Cast & Netflix üëå",5
"I'm still struggling to understand the hate surrounding this film. Visually is fantastic, the action is good, the story is good, the acting is great, Millie is as always great and Pratt is the comedy relief, but also great in his part. Extremely entertaining and I would have loved to have seen it on the big screen. ",5
"Despite the cool graphics and nostalgic aspects, the story was dull and I just couldn't stay interested. At times it was very obvious the actors were acting in front of a green screen. And I rarely felt there was much connection between the characters. It felt like actors performing lines with no real chemistry or connection. ",1.5

"Some of the visuals are the only thing this soulless piece of mass-produced, plastic content has in common with Simon St√•lenhag's work. Its like the only thing the Russos took from the source materials were some of the pictures - and none of the writing. The tone is all wrong, more in keeping with ""Air Bud 5"" than the haunting and melancholy world drawn and written by St√•lenhag, which feels more like 'Annihilation' or 'Stalker'. As a long-time fan of his work, I could find just about nothing to enjoy in this terrible production - except maybe the thought that the author might have received a nice check, supporting his future creative endeavors, which will likely be good - unlike this garbage. I don't know how a studio could get something just so wrong. Absolutely awful. ",0.5

I enjoyed it. I‚Äôm not sure why there is so much hate. It reminded me of old fashioned adventure films from the eighties. It kind of had that vibe. The plot was predicated but not everything needs to be an Oscar winning film. Sometimes it‚Äôs just needs to be fun. And it was. ,3.5
Great movie! The special effects and CGI were top notch.  It was a fun filled family oriented movie that helps remind us we rely too much on technology. ,4.5
"The critics are entirely wrong, and almost stopped me from watching a great thoughtful movie. There are layers here. If you're looking at this as a Transformers live-action film you'll say good effects dumb plot. But if you look beyond the effects and the plot to the performances, themes, and allegories, you'll find a much more layered film text than you've been led to believe. Incredible actors, visual spectacle, comedy, pathos, and a timely message: Stop hating those who are different from you, and get offline and connect with the physical world and other people. It seems online trolls could benefit. Also, alternate nineties nostalgia complete with soundtrack? I'm here for it.",5
"to all those who have a huge hatred for this beautiful comic masterpiece of a film with absolutely insanely cool CGI and a story that kicks your legs out. and can make even the girl who hates sci-fi shed a tear, I just want to say, look around and polish your glasses, go outside and get some fresh air and watch it again because that's what I plan to do",5
Idk what people expected. It's a great family movie.,4.5
"Technically brilliant and deserves the attention of any sci fi fan! 

This  might not be  Dune but the world building is still exquisite for anyone of a certain age!

It also has a fantastic soundtrack!

The film is a wonderful piece of escapism but it also touches on themes that are a lot deeper than you may think on first viewing. 

I have read some of the first negative critic reviews but on this occasion you should not listen to them.  

This is great sci fi for anyone who loves the genre.

Far, far. fa, far more entertaining than the brutalist!",5
Surprised at how good this actually was. I mean it's not amazing and drags a bit but on the whole is fun movie for the whole family and there is a lot to like about it. The critics generally I think on this occasion need to bore off. If your after a decent family movie to kill a couple of hours with some genuine heart... then look no further. ,3.5
"I loved this film. Lighthearted with depth. The tin vintage robots were adorable. I loved the style and nostalgia it gave me. The relationship Brown & Pratt have with the robots is so lovely.

 A unique take on a robot film- set in the 90s in an alternate historical reality. This film takes retro style machinery and uses it in a modern way, allowing the viewer to see the parallels and addressing our future relationship to technology.  It even touches on the moral questions of life support. 

Very clever and heartfelt. ",5
"This movie is the example of having all Material capabilities and still flop anyway ..why? Well...

The writing sucks (includes the joke that you probably heard in every movie before)
The graphic (the highlights of the movie)is not even that great ,specially after you spend all this money 
Having all these big names and still couldn't save the movie 
The actors didn't have any chemistry (if they didn't already have other projects I would assume they can't even act)

If you love the novel don't let this movie ruin it for you ‚ú®Ô∏è",0.5
"A great movie. I do not understand the hate for it. Comedy, great CGI and overall good. Not the best but definitely not bad!",4
"Whats the problem that critics and you guys have with good make ans fun movies? It's a good history, very touch, great effectswell.made, good actors. What's entertainment movies has to do to get attractive nowadays?  It's worth to watch with your family. It's fantasy with a adviser from real life notes, just like player numer one, another nice movie and under rated. Just see it and have fun",5
"To be honest, I think this was a great movie! I don‚Äôt know why so many people are hating on it. They could have made the storyline a bit more unique, thats all I have to say.",4.5
"Alright, buckle up, buttercups, because 'Electric State' just plugged directly into my happy place! Seriously, this movie was like someone peeked into my brain and said, 'Let's throw every awesome thing in there, crank it to eleven, and then add a healthy dose of pure, unadulterated silliness.'

Did I want epic robot battles? Check. Did I want a post-apocalyptic wasteland that was somehow both gritty and gorgeous? Double check. Did I want a main character who could kick butt and crack a joke in the same breath? You betcha!
This movie knew exactly what it was, and it didn't waste a second trying to pretend it was something else. It embraced the absurdity, threw in some truly laugh-out-loud moments, and never once felt the need to drown us in heavy-handed drama. It was the perfect blend of action, adventure, and 'wait, did that just happen?' hilarity.

'Electric State' isn't trying to win an Oscar for profound philosophical insights. It's trying to give you a wild, fun ride, and it succeeds spectacularly. If you're looking for a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and just delivers pure, unadulterated entertainment, then plug into 'Electric State.' You won't regret it!

Est√° entretenida la pel√≠cula los robots ü§ñ la actuaci√≥n de Chris Pratt es buena ,3.5
After reading all the critics reviews of this movie you‚Äôd think it was horrible. I watched it and enjoyed the ride. It was a fun movie. We‚Äôre in a world where a bad review gets more attention than a good one. ,5
"Great fun if a little predictable. Lots of action, great robots, and I liked the transfer of self into robot avatars. Some harsh criticisms have missed the point as critics often do, taking themselves far too seriously. Family film, easy to watch in these days of pseudo intellectuals who have lost their inner child and imagination. ",4
Mich hat der Film gut unterhalten und ja ich bin jemand der die Buchvorlage nicht kennt. Warum der Film allerdings so teuer sein soll verstehe ich nicht ganz.,4
"Nothing more than CGI slop, I would only recommend it if you‚Äôre doing something else and just want something to play in the background.",2
"The attempt to Forster warm fussy feeling on the USA in the early mid ninety failed. If your going to use the big guns from flims and TV from the period. USE them for more than background . I ended up plays name the..... A few times. The reason why I think it is worth watching is the central story of Michelle and her brother. Something I have never seen in this type of film from then was the damsel, or the male equivalent ending there story in that fashion 
",3.5
"Should have titled this movie Rip Off Player One. Between stealing storylines between that, Surrogates, Spock's Brain, and The Phantom Menace, it feels like I've seen this movie 5 times already. Not much original material here. Pratt is always reliable in his usual unlikely, unconventional hero role (it's about as much range as he has) and the visuals are pretty good. Strip out the Sci-fi and the plot is basically a rerun of Family Ties. You gotta love Harrelson in any role he plays. He always commits to the part. Brown is a bad actress  in everything she does, but she has a pretty face, so whatever. ",2.5
"It's boring. Gave up after 20 mins. Like so many Netflix USA shows this year it's all style and no substance. Maybe you should spend next years production budget in Europe and Asia as they seem too make the best shows.... Adolescent, toxic town the leopard. Most of your viewers are now outside the US...maybe consider this.",1
"The aesthetic was nice, the production was good, the acting was actually pretty decent.
All of this is let down by the horrible plot and non-existient character development. You can really feel it was a shallow YA novel that was adapted into a very ""paint-by-numbers"" adaptation with zero tension or impact. It's hard to enjoy the movie when an increasingly larger part of my brain was constantly screaming how stupid everything was, from the premise to the world to the battle scenes to the characters.",1.5
A blast from start to finish. This is bubblegum silliness at its best. There is depth to the story and quirkiness to the characters and fantastic special effects. I don‚Äôt know what people who are complaining are looking for. This does what it sets out to do and does it well.,5
"What was there not to like? I went in with low expectations because of the ""professional"" opinions. It was different. Great visuals. It was funny. If they had killed my favorite character (who was not one of the main characters) maybe I would be writing a different review but I don't think so. Some of the reviews I have read feel like they were written by people who watched a different movie than I did. ",5
"I found this film a satisfying and enjoyable watch.  The story was pretty simple but still enough to hold my attention.  I enjoy action films with a bit of levity and this delivers a few nice lighthearted moments.  The acting was good and I would say people should give this a go an ignore the negative critics ratings.  You can always quit partway through if it doesn't appeal, but I think you might be surprised.",4
"Just a fun watch for a Saturday night. It's an interesting premise with a bunch of funny subtle references, lots of comedy and action, and good acting. I never listen to the critics, just check out the Academy awards for the past 10 years.",4.5
It was fun and interesting. Fall Out vibes with a 90's twist. Funny and a decent message.,5
"The author of ""The Electric State"" Simon Stalenhag gave his approval for the film as did the audience as you can see. I specifically love the performances of the dynamic duo Millie Bobby Brown & Chris Pratt, I feel theses two really shined in this film together, I would love to see this duo in another film. ",5
"Well, I must have watched a different movie than the rest of these reviewers, but then I wasn't expecting more than to be entertained for a couple of hours with some mindless meaningless fun.... And that's what I got. So if you're expecting Tolstoy or Shakespeare then you will be sadly disappointed. This is more like top gun. It's popcorn for the soul.",4.5
"Entretenida con mas pretensiones que lo que finalmente consigue, la historia esta bien pero no consigue enganchar.",3.5
Fun movie for a time where life can be overwhelming!,4.5
"This movie is so chalk full of clich√©s that it could be best utilized as a drinking game and far less as an actual movie to sit and watch. The script is surprisingly bad. That said, the visuals are very good, but that alone can only carry your interest so long while so many other elements seemed designed to annoy. ",1
I have no idea why the critics canned this.  It had a strange 2nd act when we meet the doctor with glasses but the rest was funny and engaging.,5
"Soulless, actorless, plotless, storyless, targetless, innovationless, characterless, pathosless. GPT made.",0.5
I don‚Äôt understand all the hate either. Is it a classic? No. Is it predictable? Yes. Is it enjoyable? Definitely! Is it a waste of time? Not at all. Should you watch it? Yes. ,5
"Another Robopoclypse Epic...This made-for-tv Netflix movie based on an old graphic novel...It's ambitious, and not as bad as everyone says it is ...But it's not good either...The problem really here is with the script.  This stuff is too predictable; too passe. And way too CUTESY...And a couple cool sequences here and there don't save it.  (For a much better take on this subject try last year's Creator; that was brilliant!)",2
"Fun movie, mixed 90s references with some post apocalyptic fun. Made pretty well. Not sure why movie critics have a job anymore, they are mostly out of touch with the fans.",5
"I could barely watch up until the middle, but then just gave up. It's so extremely boring and so disappointingly empty, despite basing off the great original work of Simon St√•lenhag.",0.5
" Visually, it was very entertaining. 
The Storyline felt predictable, but special moments sprinkled throughout pulled it forward.
I found it difficult to emotionally connect with the ribots' plight, so I watched solely for entertainment...and it delivered.",4
"Would have been a much better watch had they not cast Chris Pratt. Absolute movie killer, takes you right out of it. ",1.5
"Ok so there aren't Oscars happening here (do you really want to go to the cinema always and feel like your heart is broken?) but omg what a popcorn chomping, coke guzzling throwback to the 80's/90's this movie is!! It's got a good story, it keeps you entertained and it is FUN! ",5
"made an account just to say how dogshit this adaptation was. the source material had so much great sceneries and robot designs, then the russo brothers turned it into a bland netflix slop",0.5
"The Electric State"" is a visually stunning, emotionally gripping film that delivers exactly what it sets out to‚Äîa fun, immersive, and nostalgic journey through a uniquely crafted world. I watched it last night, and it was everything a great movie should be: entertaining, heartfelt, and visually mesmerizing. If you grew up in the '90s, the soundtrack alone is enough to hit you with waves of nostalgia, pulling you deeper into the film‚Äôs atmosphere.

Critics, once again, have completely missed the point. Instead of appreciating the film‚Äôs artistry, emotional depth, and world-building, they‚Äôve nitpicked over superficial details, as if every movie has to fit into some rigid, formulaic structure to be considered 'good.' Their inability to engage with films outside of their usual criteria only exposes how disconnected they are from actual audiences.

Ignore the critics. This is a film worth experiencing for yourself. It‚Äôs the kind of movie that reminds you why you fell in love with cinema in the first place.",5
"The producers should be commended for trying to give us something new rather than another remake, sequel, prequel, or origin story of a tired intellectual property that ran its course 3 or 4 films ago. I have been a fan of Simon St√•lenhag's artwork for several years now and thought the film was able to bring out his artistic vision. There are certainly some plot holes, but it is enjoyable as long as you allow for some suspension of disbelief.",4
"I haven‚Äôt read the graphic novel and sometimes it helps to be unprepared, as you‚Äôre less likely to have narrow expectations. I had read the terrible critic reviews and was pleasantly surprised. The movie is imaginative and magical. It really looks amazing. The story is wonderful and I felt immersed in this parallel universe. It is also funny and a good, family movie. I thought the cast was great! Millie really added to the nostalgic energy to what felt like could be a classic movie. I do wonder if the directors rushed certain elements which meant it just fell short of accomplishing it. I do hope there will be a sequel. ",4
"I just finished, and I personally loved it like a lott. I would give it a solid 9.5/10ü´∂üèº I cried, laughed, sang, danced, and got angry at some of the characters, and it was amazing‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π I don't understand why there is so much hate against this movie because it was amazing‚ú®Ô∏è",5
"It was an pretty good movie, CGI was great and acting was done pretty well, but it was a played out plot that you aren't going to remember anything about in 2 weeks",4
"This is an awesome movie that hits all the emotions: humor, sadness, anger, and empathy. 
The subtle allusions to what‚Äôs actually happening in the world are thought provoking. ",5
I am not sure why this movie has beat up by the critics. It has a solid plot and great effects. The cast is fantastic. I truly enjoyed the movie. I wonder sometimes do the critics watch the same movies I do?,4.5
This was probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The fact that major movie stars were attached to this is astounding to me. Is distended and broken. Get a screenwriter and director who who's what the hell they're doing. Wow....just so horrible. ,0.5
"I honestly dont know why people say they dont like it, and make so big fuss about the budget... If you can do it for cheaper and better, please do.... 
I must say, I enjoyed the movie alot. I loved the robots, the creativity that was used, and the storyline. It was something different  that I liked, as it has been a while since a film has captivated me. Lately most films are all predictable and in the same line and boring. I did get all the humor and emotions and will definitely watch it again. Cudos to all involved making this film and the great actors!!! ",5
"Chriss and G are the only ones tried to save the movie......the girls acting is dumb and for some reason,the russo brothers saw it is good........very cringe,very not into character, dialogues doesn't feel deep with the characters,no deep connections or anything............she completely ruined the movie,every scene she's in,its horrible (and she's in the whole movie) ,the first 30mins are enough for people to walk out/quit watching the entire movie ",1
I loved this movie as a fan of robots i was so exited to watch it. loved the story a girl trying to save her brother from a big company i say this movie was 9/10 i would have liked to see more robots and more big ones and a bigger fight.,5
"I don‚Äôt understand why this film was so criticized. I found it to be a great movie, with a valuable message about connection in an increasingly individualistic and digitally immersed world. The reviews are positive, the actors‚Äô performances are excellent, the cinematography is beautiful, and the film‚Äôs pacing is very well executed. For me, it‚Äôs a 10/10!",5
"Kids pooed themselves sadly, abysmal masterclass on how to throw away 320 million supposed dollars",0.5
Loved it! Gave me the fall out vibes. ,5
"What is going on with the critics? Really? Just because they decide to hate something they lose the good judgment, the story of the movie is interesting and the construction of the characters is well made, it‚Äôs not perfect but it‚Äôs not that bad, the visual effects are very convincing, give it a try! This movie won‚Äôt disappoint",4.5
Well this was terrible i wouldn't blame Russo brothers they are great this is just a very odd franchise to adaptation to live action ,0.5
This movie is dreadful. An outstanding cast except for Millie Bobby Brown. She is awful. Chris Pratt is his usual funny self. Everyone else tried but geez nothing can salvage this mess.,0.5
"I wasn't expecting much from it, but with it being a Russo Brothers film, and having an awesome cast, I figured I'd give it a chance.

It's nothing amazing, but it's actually a fun and entertaining movie! The story actually gets you a bit invested, and it kind of reminded me of a mix of Iron Giant and Ready Player One. CGI is really good, Chris Pratt and Millie Bobby Brown are great, and the supporting cast are awesome too. I especially loved Herman, who's voiced by Anthony Mackie, which i didn't realize until I saw the credits (obviously a VERY MCU cast, but great picks, of course).

Overall, worth a watch if you have some time and want to watch something on Netflix.",3.5
"I enjoyed the story and it was different from most live action movies currently. It had some good humor and decent battle scenes loaded with plenty of star power. For 2 hrs let go of taking yourself so serious and just get lost in a story about family, loss, humanity and good vs evil. Enjoy üòâ and don't pay attention to the ""critics"" if it we're left to them there'd be nothing to watch or it would just be repetitive material. The creative swings, even if misses would cease to exist.",4

Great work!!
It goes to show you the so called Top Critics Should Not be in the business of reviewing movies, Most of them don't know what they are talking about.",5
"T.E.S. is not really that good of a movie, but it is not as bad as some of the reviews suggest. Let's just say that the two hours it takes to watch the movie are not a waste of time, but they'll be two hours that you don't really feel any need to remember.",2.5
Critics are useless. Never follow their opinions.  ,5
My husband and I watched the movie last night. Despite the critics we thought it was pretty good. I have no complaints at all. It kept us entertained. ,5
I enjoyed this movie. The special effects are amazing. The robots look real. ,4.5
"Fun and absorbing throughout but touchy towards the end, but then the last scene suggests there might be a sequel. Hurrah!",3.5
That there is two hours I will never get back!!! (And this seems to be a bit of a backslide for Chris Pratt),2
"A movie whose greatest achievement is how effectively its creators eradicated the soul of the original work upon which it's based. The visual effects are pretty good too.

I don't know if it's too much botox or acting ability, but, Millie Bobby Brown does an incredible job of hiding the fact that emotions exist, with her entire range expressed through the volume of her voice.

Chris Pratt is, again, Chris Pratt. One time he's called upon to display something other than ""wise-cracking rogue with a heart of gold"" is flatter than an empty can stood on by an 80 feet tall robot.

Much the same goes for the rest of the humans, and I can only imagine that they were instructed to ""Play it exactly how you did in the thing that you're best known for.""

The original work (of the same title), is a subtle, beautiful, and beautifully haunting, thought provoking, mysterious, piece of art (well several pieces of art in fact). Like the best sci-fi it invites the reader to ask questions about the world in its pages and, ultimately, our own.

The only question Netflix's 'The Electric State' gets the viewer to ask is, ""How did they manage to miss the mark so widely?""

",1
"I was going to avoid this movie because of the terrible critical reviews. I‚Äôm glad I gave it a shot. The movie was very visual, and had some pretty impressive effects in it. The story was solid, and had funny and touching moments. The soundtrack was awesome and heavy on 90‚Äôs nostalgia. Altogether I would say the movie was really good and didn‚Äôt deserve a lot of the negative reviews it got. ",4
"Slow, formulaic, cliched, disjointed, and barely watchable. Chris Pratt appears to blow his lines several times, or delivers them poorly, it's hard to tell which. The directing is basic. The acting is subpar. Honestly, it's just not a very good movie.",2
"Me and my family watched the trailer and thought this was going to be a good movie, and we were so wrong. Everything about this movies is absolutely dog shart. I wish I could give this zero reviews. My family agreed that the writes of this movies were has high as a rocket. ",1
"Well shock, the paid critics are wrong again. This is a really good movie.!particularly loved the design of the bots and the world in general.
Chris and Millie are of course great and charming and work well together.
I‚Äôm sorry but if you can‚Äôt enjoy this movie get a different job. ",4.5
"Perfect movie to watch while cooking or scrolling through social media. Not bad, but there is something missing. Besides, such a big production shouldn‚Äôt have tired a theatrical release? ",3
"Slow pace, puerile dialogue but a nice visual style.",1
"The Electric State is a visually stunning film that delivers an immersive and creative experience. The design of the robots is nothing short of amazing, evoking a strong Fallout-like aesthetic that adds depth to the worldbuilding. The artistry and attention to detail in these visuals make the movie stand out, offering a post-apocalyptic feel that is both haunting and beautiful.

While the storyline has a few weaker points, the overall experience remains highly enjoyable. The film has strong rewatchability, with layers of detail that make each viewing rewarding. The Russo brothers did a great job bringing this unique vision to life, and I sincerely hope we see more films like this in the future‚Äîthere simply aren‚Äôt enough of them.

If you're a fan of rich, atmospheric sci-fi with a touch of nostalgia, The Electric State is definitely worth watching.",5
Critics definitely  missed the mark on this one.  I haven't been able to disconnect and enjoy a movie like this in a while.  Yes the plot is pretty basic but connecting with the characters (Both human and robot) was very easy.  I really enjoyed the comedy and action this movie brings.   The critics just seem to want to hear the own voices rather than just sit down and enjoy a movie for what it is. ,4.5
"I don't get the negative reviews, especially the cridicts. Which isn't surprising since they hate about every movie. ",5
I find it sad that people who like this movie might not like the book.,0.5
"'The Electric State' is an incredibly formulaic sci-fi blockbuster that relies on spectacle rather than substance, delivering a pretty but hollow experience. ",2.5
"One of the film‚Äôs biggest weaknesses, however, is its antagonist. While the overarching conflict adds stakes to Michelle‚Äôs journey, the villain lacks a strong presence. Giancarlo Esposito, who plays a secondary antagonist, brings his usual gravitas to the role and is far more convincing than the film‚Äôs primary villain, making one wish he had more screen time or been given a more central role.

Chris Pratt delivers a surprisingly heartfelt performance, and his character‚Äôs bond with Herm is the heart of the movie. Their interactions add weight to the story and help ground the film in an emotional reality that keeps audiences engaged.

Woody Norman, in a supporting role, impressively steals scenes, at times overshadowing Millie Bobby Brown‚Äôs protagonist. While Brown gives a solid performance, Norman‚Äôs nuanced acting and screen presence elevate his character beyond expectations.

Despite some missteps, The Electric State is carried by strong performances and a well-crafted world. The film‚Äôs emotional core and striking visuals make it worth watching, even if it falters in villain execution and character balance.",3.5
"For once I can agree with the critics, skip this silly movie if you are older than 8. ",0.5
"My mom and I watched the movie and loved it!!! It has emotions, comedy and lots of action",5
"It was a surprising and real mix of genre, storytelling and visual impact. Reminiscent of the films from the 80s its graphic style is aimed at young people with adult overtones. I can understand why some people feel let down as it‚Äôs a bit of a ramble and some of the editing is quite jarring, but it‚Äôs still (somehow) completely believable. The actors are all fab, hold the story together well and, again, somehow you don‚Äôt lose track of what is happening. The cast of robots and ‚Äòrobot world‚Äô are fantastic, unusual and well conceived. A sweet, nostalgic humorous with a large tasty twist of weird randomness. A good watch that perhaps needed a bit more consistency as sometimes it feels like three different films running at once, but super enjoyable nonetheless. 
",3.5
"Honestly, the plot for the first hour is a bit slow. Then, the character development is not explained enough and the ending is also not impressive. For the actors Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt I admit they are really cool, but the rest are still lacking in acting, but this movie is still enjoyable to watch.",3.5
another demonstration that critics and people are very different. this film is fun and exciting and transports us to a dystopian world that allows us to unplug for 2 hours. transmitting the message that we should be more human,5
"Really good story, great visual, a little humour and moral
Perfectüëå",4.5
This movie was actually really fun! I don‚Äôt understand why they made it PG-13 but it was great! I loved the choices for the actors. I don‚Äôt know why people are rating this poorly. It was a pleasant surprise that I enjoyed watching with my family.,4
Worst editing I‚Äôve ever seen. Why cut away from your main star in mid dialogue every time they talk in the first 10 min of movie. So many expo dumps that dont even amount to making the world make sense. ,0.5
The negative reviews are crazy. This setting is amazing. And the acting is an all-star line up. Makes me want to play the RPG,5
"I'd been looking forward to this and was hoping that Simon St√•lenhag's morbidly fascinating post apocalyptic images would provide a haunting background for what I had read was to be  Michelle's quest to find her brother, but the opportunity was thrown away to showcase the undeniably good  robot designs, CGI and routine battles.  The storyline, such as it is, was poorly supported with little or no background to the introduction and rise to ubiquity of Neurocasters and what they allowed one to do (except perhaps make the wearer look like a giant anteater with an iPhone strapped to it's nose.  I'm guessing it locks you into a permanent recurring Netflix subscription into the next century or possibly listening to the Electric State's dismal music score again.  I knew it was the ultimate evil as soon as I saw one.  Anyway, on the bright side, this movie almost certainly wins at least one award: The credits run for a fraction under fifteen minutes and reveal that the budget allowed the producers to hire everyone in California although they feel twice as long since the director seems to have opted to use music rescued from the sound editor's  waste bin.  Combine end credits from The Longest Day, Star Wars (pick any three)  Lord of the Rings Return of the King, The Poseidon Adventure and any two of the Godfather epics. Throw in  Lawrence Of Arabia for good measure and you'll get an idea of the ordeal that awaits those determined to see it through to the end.",2.5
It was a fun watch. I enjoyed the style and effects of the world. ,4
"The Electric State was released on Netflix and a limited run in theatres on March 14th, 2025. It stars Christopher Pratt, Millie Bobby Brown, and others in another alternate universe film. A robot revolt took place years ago and now humanity has become addicted to a VR type machine. Brown must travel to a Mad Max type area to both save her brother and free humanity. The Electric State, for me at least, was a fun movie. Yes, it has the classic sci-fi tropes of plucky underdog, rebellion versus the empire themes etc., but it's still entertaining. Brown is miscast, she plays a teenager lol, but both she and Pratt do a good job and the CGI is largely impressive. Add in a decent soundtrack, some funny moments, and few exciting action scenes and you get a good but not great movie that is certainly worth a watch.",4
Don‚Äôt let the paid critics GASLIGHT you . Fun stuff ‚Äî it‚Äôs what movies are about: imagination and adventure. Should be on a big screen.,4.5
"I thought it was bueatifully made, my daughter hates movies as a 16 yr old and immediately was drawn into it. It was magical and tragic at the same time. There was bravery, comradery, multiple point of views, all around enticing movie. Plus the ending giving way to a possible 2nd movie and overall happy ending. I loved it and my whole family fully enjoyed it. There doesn't always have to be some major deep hidden meaning. It's nice to just have a good movie for once that is actually different but family friendly. Yes most movies have similar aspects to them, but it doesn't make them slop. Your perception I guess is what makes it good or bad or if your just in the moment for entertainment. We cant wait to see it again!",4
"Although the storyline does take a lot of cut and paste from several different dystopian movies along with some influences from Marvel and certainly a nod to Star Wars with Chris Pratt dressing and acting like Han Solo, this film is a great adventure for young children and adult nerds such as myself. It has the capability to be a cult classic one day along side Alita battle angel for future generations. It was  also great to see a 90s theme rather than the tired 80s we keep seeing within films. ",3.5
"Not terrible but borrows heavily from other, better, movies, Ready Player One comes to mind. The story is very simplistic as it often goes with these types of stories.",3
"The acting is (unsurprisingly) atrocious. Stanley Tucci and Ke Huy Quan should of said no to this movie. Millie... just be yourself.
Chris Pratt... fair enough. You did your best",1

üëåüèº excellent. Critic's have it wrong bigtime.,5
I thought it was a fun and quirky movie.  I don't know why the critics are so hard on it.,5
"This interesting take on an ""us vs. them"" robot movie had a refreshing story and was just good entertainment for the entire family. A refreshing Netflix movie without the junk included.",5
"Visually, it's just short of breathtaking but with such a poorly realized script, there's nothing for that beauty to adhere to. 

We jump right into the war and have no sense of what this world is, just a very narrow sliver that's curated to show only the negative. The only character that gets any development is Giancarlo Esposito, and that's only in the closing act. 

This could have worked as a TV series but 2 hours isn't enough time for the audience to care, or maybe the script wasn't good enough to do that job. 

If you like dystopian fiction, you might enjoy it. Otherwise, you can skip it. ",1.5
"This movie completely betrays the source material.  The book by Stalenhag was was beautifully dour, wrought with thoughtful, reflective melancholy.  It was dark, with themes of addiction that results in neurocaster users literally wasting away while they are plugged in... frighteningly relatable today.  My point is that it was a very adult book.

So what does the Hollywood circus parade of knuckleheads do?  They make a kids movie out of it.  If you are familiar with the source material, it is akin to turning Saving Private Ryan into a children's movie.  The score was also disjointed and so out of place at times that it completely removed me from the viewing experience, like being snapped out of a daydream.  It was really not done well.  And let's not forget the orchestral version of Journey's ""Don't Stop Believing"" getting yanked right out of The Wedding Singer for use in this film.  Of course, Adam Sandler is a Netflix indentured servant now, so...  anyway, I dare you to watch Electric State again and NOT think of the Wedding Singer when this bit of composition hits your ears.

Even as a stand alone movie, if you forget about the source material, it was poorly acted.  Brown is capable of being completely bland, and over acting, simultaneously.  Pratt should have been written as a hardened, broken, post-war vet.  Instead, we got the bits of Quill that were pulled out of the GoG script, with little mascot and all.  He looked disinterested.  I don't blame him though, he probably hated the script as much as me.

I gave it two stars because it was visually stunning.  I guess that's what $300 million gets ya.  I'm glad it was free on Netflix, because it was exceedingly disappointing.",2
"Don't listen to these so called ""critics"". This movie is amazing!",4.5
"Well, it's generic? Yes, but it definitely ISN'T bad. It's very well made, it has good perfomances, and the effects are amazing!! 8.5/10",4.5
"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was well shot, which I found very impressive given all the CGI. The CGI was also really well done (like Davey Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean good). Well acted by Chris Pratt and Millie Bobbie Brown. Woody Harrelson does a good job voicing Mr. Peanut. Kudos to the crew and cast for an action movie that‚Äôs not a boring sequel or reboot. ",5
"There‚Äôs so much I can say about this movie as I‚Äôm trying to get my thoughts together. I think it‚Äôs a RARE movie. Original. A Bold movie. It really shows how the Russo Brothers can make movies outside of Marvel! I feel they made a masterpiece with The Electric State! It‚Äôs a RARE movie in terms of storytelling and the messages throughout the film. Even though it is a Sci-Fi film in an alternate version of the 90‚Äôs, there‚Äôs so many surreal moments that I feel replicate things of how people use their technology in real life. That‚Äôs a bold message in itself. There‚Äôs a lot of rarity about this movie in terms of the messages! Also I‚Äôll make sure I say NO SPOILERS. I think everyone should watch The Electric State to see how all the messages and how the story is crafted. It‚Äôs something to witness and I will watch it again. Millie Bobby Brown brings Michelle to life in her story. You get to see a heartwarming family dynamic with Michelle and her brother Christopher, and then how as things progress how her life is turned upside down. I think it deals with grief in a masterful way. Where I feel it does punch you in the face with feels. Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt both hold a lot of the emotional weight of the movie and they do it really well. Really RARE message at the very end of the movie. A fantastic way to end the movie. I feel that message for the movie is a nice send off message the Russo Brothers want to convey to the audience. It‚Äôs a very uplifting and kind one. Millie Bobby Brown also really plays off well with Chris Pratt as Keats! His introduction scene, Chris Pratt really adds to the movie and story! I‚Äôll say he has a definition of swagger in his introduction scene. Another layer of cool. I also feel that Chris Pratt is a scene stealer in the movie. I think this movie will surprise people as I was greatly surprised in terms of where it would go. We also have voice talents of the cast. One being I loved Woody Harrelson as Mr. Peanut! We have the voice talents also of Jenny Slate, Brian Cox, Anthony Mackie, Colman Domingo and Giancarlo Esposito. We have Stanley Tucci who really plays a good villain you might want to punch in the face. There‚Äôs something fun and whimsical about the robots. Everyone should watch this movie!",5
"For me, despite all the negative reviews, this came out of the left field and hit home. Good casting and a lot of great one liners.",4
"""The Electric State"" is great. The critics could not have been more wrong. ",5
This is an excellent movie. ,5
"If there‚Äôs any critique, it would be that the pacing in some parts may feel slow for those expecting a more action-heavy film. However, the film‚Äôs emotional weight and thought-provoking themes make up for it, leaving a lasting impact.",5
I liked the movie! The end. ,5
"This movie is fine... melodramatic start. Muddling middle with a decent to good ending.

Was it worth the money they spent, probably not... but what you have is a fun movie with some of the BEST voice talent ever assembled into a single project with some great music and visuals to boot.

Is it just me or at her age, Millie Bobby Brown can do a spot-on American accent (as she's been doing for years... but it always jars me hearing her normal voice in interviews and such)?

Not great, but not lacking entertainment value.",3
"From start to finish this was a great fun adventure. The tech, the story, the heart all added up to something I smiled while watching. Nostalgia like a Spielberg from added to a lot of really great creative CGI to boot. The actors did a great job and of course so did the voice actors. I really had a comic book scifi moment with this movie.

Running around as getting chased by the big bad it's common but it's how the heart of it makes you feel good going on the adventure in this alternate future, but still very similar theme to the creator. You'll never look at animatronics the same ever again. I hope they make this into a sandbox game is would be amazing.",5
"Its got great visual design throughout, as for if its a good movie, its as good as other hollywood movies...Am I giving it an extra star to bring the average rating up - Yes, yes I am. ",5
"I enjoyed this film and got exactly what I wanted from it. The top-notch CGI brings the mechanical world to life, while Chris Pratt and Millie Bobby Brown‚Äôs charm make it even more entertaining. Though the story isn‚Äôt groundbreaking and has some familiar moments, its creativity, stunning visuals and oddball characters kept me engaged for the entire two-hour runtime. The Electric State delivers a thrilling and visually captivating experience for sci-fi and adventure fans alike‚Äîand is definitely worth seeing.",4
"I'm about to start it but in case I forget I wanted to voice my displeasure at it being PG-13 instead of R and at having such recognizable actors and maybe for spending too much money but we'll see. I have a feeling that watching video essays about the source material is going to make this a hard watch as I have specific expectations that are going to be hard to check at the door.

Post watch: holy crap was I wrong! It's not the movie I wanted but it's pretty great. Enjoyable characters, decent acting, good effects. Much as I want a darker version this I can watch with my step daughter so there's that. ",4
"The critics are drunk or high or both. This movie is literally what the movies are all about. It's fun, entertaining, downright hilarious and wholesome all at the same time.

Seems like the critics think every movie out here is trying to contend for picture of the year.. News flash. They aren't. This movies plot isn't some brand new take that's going to knock your socks off. But it fmdiesnt need to be. The plot is engaging and the characters are fantastic.

Critics keep saying it's 2 hours of your life you will never get back. That's the worst take of the year. Microwave some popcorn, grab the kids, and sit down and have a dang good time for 2 hours. Thank me later. ",5
"I liked the movie. Cannot understand the bad critics. Was expecting the worst after reading all the bad reviews. But turned out they were BS and the movie entertained me good. 
Never trust the critics, that's sth I learned for a while now.",4.5
OK movie but not worth all the hype ,2
"The 'critic' reviews show how irrelevant they are. Not earth shattering but good backstory, good writing, very good CGI and good performances. Definetely worth a watch.",4
I usually dont agree with critic reviews but this was a terrible movie with an inflated budget. It was predictable and unfunny.,0.5
Great popcorn movie with a great cast!,4
"Electric State bietet auf den ersten Blick eine interessante futuristische Welt, die optisch durchaus einiges zu bieten hat. Die visuelle Umsetzung wirkt ansprechend und zeigt Ans√§tze, die das Genre bereichern k√∂nnten. Insbesondere die futuristischen Landschaften und die Produktionselemente vermitteln eine gewisse Atmosph√§re, die neugierig macht.

Allerdings kommt es an der Story und der Charakterentwicklung zu kurz. Die Handlung wirkt schnell abgefertigt und ist in vielerlei Hinsicht zu vorhersehbar. Es fehlen √ºberraschende Wendungen und eine tiefere Auseinandersetzung mit den Figuren, sodass man als Zuschauer nur selten wirklich emotional abgeholt wird. Trotz der ambiti√∂sen Pr√§misse bleibt der Film insgesamt oberfl√§chlich und bietet mehr Routine als innovative Ideen.

Fazit:
Electric State ist ein solider Sci-Fi-Film, den man sich anschauen kann, wenn man in die futuristische Welt eintauchen m√∂chte ‚Äì jedoch bleibt er als Durchschnittswerk ohne echte Highlights zur√ºck. Ein klassischer 08-15-Film, der zwar unterh√§lt, aber nicht nachhaltig im Ged√§chtnis bleibt.",1.5
Great movie. I hope there‚Äôs a second!,4.5
this was so good. if u thought this was bad then lower ur damn ego. couldve used the 320mil a little better but still so awesome and emotional.,5
"The Russo Brothers has yet again given us satisfying entertainment with this retro-futuristic movie.
'THE ELECTRIC STATE' delivers a well blend of sci-fi coupled with not to many but accurate action scenes. Although the movie isn't the best from the brilliant directors it's definitely not their worst too.
In this thriller we see a world of robots vs. humans and though there were some plot holes and some performances weren't ""there"" the Russo Brothers' managed to blend action with sentimentality but not at the cost of humor.

All being said, 'THE ELECTRIC STATE' was worth the watch.",3.5
"Nope. What a wasted opportunity. Remove the actors, add unknown actors for believability, and make it darker.  ",1
"I will say not bad, funny and good special effects. More interesting to watch than Mikey 17",4
Yet another  lowest common denominator movie. Netflix movies exist to prove the fact that most people have bad taste. ,0.5
"Boring, tonally mixed, terrible performances, awful dialogue, pacing all over the show.

One star for the CGI and robot designs.
Half a star for MBB's lips.",1.5
Great writing and great cast. Special effectser A+. Great cinematography a great story It was a pleasure to watch this film sometimes I scratch my head as to why the so-called real professional reviewers are so hateful on a film.,5
"I watched this together with my spouse, and we both enjoyed it thoroughly. It reminded us of Ready Player One and also ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence‚Äù (the Spielberg film). The practical effects were especially pleasing to see, and also the outdoor sets. The robot designs were just enough 1950‚Äôs style to not be too creepy.

A good popcorn film.",4.5
"We have yet another 2025 movie where Ke Huy Quan is the best part of the film! Unfortunately he‚Äôs not in this for very long (and it‚Äôs mostly a voice over role)‚Ä¶ so it‚Äôs overall very generic and forgettable. How this movie is one of the most expensive ever made I will never know. The Russo Brothers have yet to deliver a good movie outside of Marvel, and still studios give them ginormous budgets for them to deliver background noise like this. Where are the guys who delivered some of the most crowd pleasing and entertaining movies I‚Äôve ever seen? With Marvel, they really seemed to be in touch with what the audience wanted and knew how to deliver a solid final product, but here it‚Äôs like they‚Äôve forgotten everything. I just cannot comprehend how they went from Endgame to this kind of narrative blunder and shot to shot incompetence. That not only goes for the Russo‚Äôs, but also writers Markus and McFeely. The Electric State, while slightly better than what people are saying, is your typical generic streaming/Netflix movie. It prioritizes style and spectacle over substance, resulting in a somewhat lifeless experience that (somehow) manages to deliver a few emotions by the end. Some of the character dynamics are fun, but the final package features FAR more misses than hits. It doesn‚Äôt help that Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt have no chemistry, and their performances are stiff and lifeless. It boasts a really cool premise but ultimately falls short. I remember being excited by the idea and concept art‚Ä¶ and this was nothing like it. I wanted so much more from this. Typical of a Netflix film. And becoming more and more typical of the Russo‚Äôs. I just hope the next Avengers movies don‚Äôt leave me feeling the way this did. What a waste of money and a great premise. It‚Äôs pretty bad, and just disappointing. Bland nothingness.

I didn‚Äôt completely hate it, I just hate that so much money was blown on such a lacklustre movie when like 10 great ones could‚Äôve been made for that price.",2
"This is the exact movie that i expect on streaming. It's nothing new, flaud and really not that deep of a movie but looks pretty good and keeps you entertained for a while. It's the exact movie that we're talking about when saying it's something to have on in the background.",2.5
"Ignore all the critics who winge about this film! The electric state is an absolutely enjoyable film centered around Michelle (Played by Millie Bobbie Brown) who goes on a heart felt journey after discovering an illegal robot with a secret. 

This film is a fun adventure with amazing artistic design and a heartfelt story! ",5
"This was a great watch, who doesn't like watching a family friendly movie full of robots, explosions and great CGI?? My guess is the critics of today world‚Ä¶

I would watch this again in a year or two if it popes up on ‚Äúsomething you have already watched but might like again‚Äù

",5
It was boring and silly! The script is full of holes and the actors can‚Äôt carry their weight. I wish they would have spent more money on the script rather than on the special effects and on the cast. It‚Äôs a wasted opportunity to do something memorable. ,1
This  is fun movie with a great aesthetic. I loved the look of the alternate 1990s and the design of the robots. ,5
"Awesome movie, great visuals and sound. Didn‚Äôt think I could feel emotionally connected to robot characters but the film does an amazing job making you feel for them. Perfect movie for family night. Had awesome nostalgia in it as well. Don‚Äôt fall for the harsh reviews, sit back with some popcorn and let this film take you into this beautiful world they‚Äôve created.",5
"Critics out of touch again. I watched this with my family and we had a great time. Fun, well made sci fi ",5
"I‚Äôve never read the book, which is probably one reason why I found the movie quite entertaining without any particular expectations. The story felt a bit rushed and had some logical gaps, but overall, it was enjoyable and visually stunning. I can definitely recommend the film!",3.5
"This movie was amazing! I'm a big fan of Simon Stalenhag's work, and seeing it come to life was awesome. The movie had a great story and amazing visuals. I highly recommend watching it!",5
"

First off, the visuals are jaw-dropping. The Exclusion Zone is a sprawling playground of rusty robots and neon-tinged nostalgia, perfectly capturing the book‚Äôs eerie beauty. The animatronic bots‚Äîlike Cosmo and the wise-cracking Herman (voiced by Anthony Mackie)‚Äîare so lifelike you‚Äôll want to take one home. The ‚Äò90s tech vibes, with clunky VR helmets and retro-futuristic gadgets, make every frame a treat. The Russo brothers flex their blockbuster chops here, and it‚Äôs pure eye candy from start to finish.

The cast is a huge win, too. Millie Bobby Brown shines as Michelle, bringing grit and heart to her quest‚Äîshe‚Äôs the emotional anchor you can‚Äôt help but root for. Chris Pratt‚Äôs Keats is a delight, serving up charm and swagger that light up the screen. The robot crew‚ÄîWoody Harrelson, Jenny Slate, Brian Cox‚Äîadds a playful spark, their banter landing like a warm hug. Sure, the story sticks to a familiar road-trip formula, but it‚Äôs packed with enough twists and action to keep you hooked.

At its core, *The Electric State* is a fun, heartfelt adventure about connection‚Äîhuman, robot, or otherwise. It‚Äôs not here to reinvent the wheel, but it doesn‚Äôt need to. With dazzling visuals, a killer cast, and a vibe that‚Äôs equal parts nostalgic and futuristic, it‚Äôs the kind of movie that leaves you smiling. Perfect for a weekend watch with popcorn in hand!

",5
This was a really great film. Critics are tripping.,5
Fun and interesting world.   Watched with family (kids 10-16).   We all laughed and some of us cried.  It‚Äôs a nice message and a fun escape.   Daughter loved the female lead.  We will watch again as it is entertaining and didn‚Äôt cost us $100 to go out to the movies. ,5
"My impression of this film aligned perfectly with my expectations; it was an enjoyable experience, and both my friends and family shared in the enjoyment.",5
"It's a bad movie with Chris Pratt always playing the same character in The Guardians of the Galaxy saga. Millie is a woman trapped in the same character in Stranger Things, but with a different hair color. ",1
"There isn't anything quite like this out there. It has alot of 80's and 90's nostalgia, with a sci-fi twist. If your looking for Shakespeare, you won't find it here. But what you will find is a fun adventure, friendship, war, and a bond between brother and sister that those with siblings can relate to. Enjoy it for what it is and you won't be disappointed.",3.5
jeeez its ok.. its entertaining and visually nice to watch... the story and dialogue isn't the greatest but come on its not that bad.. don't think it deserves the harsh reviews.. i think critics should maybe know what they are watching before hitting play..,4
Great Movie !!! Perfect for popcorn and weekend.. great for sci Fi lovers !!!!,5
This movie was so bad so it was good in a bad way ,4
"I was exited for this mostly because I enjoy Chris Pratt mostly and a movie about robots? Hell I‚Äôm all for that! But honestly the trailers made it seem like a big fight between man and robots whereas you see like 3% of fighting in the whole movie! In the beginning it completely glosses over the WHOLE war between man and robots! I found myself very bored and waiting for it to finish, falling asleep. There was no need for this movie to be 2 hours long. The only thing that kept me going was a few laughs from Chris Pratt. I can‚Äôt help but think that had we seen the actual war it would have been a much better movie. ",1
Loved it!!! Critics are crazy for giving such bad reviews. ,5
"Ticked all the right boxes. .. a little  Drawn-out  ...  Colourful  , S.F.X GREAT 
No SWEARING  ... ",3.5
"Looks great, sounds great, and it's entertaining. Not a classic, but fun enough.",3
Unfortunately it's becoming a trend again that Critics are out of touch with audiences opinions. This was a fun family style movie. It's a love letter to this blockbuster 90s/2000s kid adventure movies but with modern efx. If I was a young boy I'd be going nuts over it. Robots are always a cool concept.  If you can't enjoy a movie like this I feel sad for you cause this is where the kid in you should be enjoying yourself. ,5
"Ignore the critics this is a solid movie for fun, friends, or even a date night. Not sure why people hating on Russo brothers they're great.",5
"The CGI is really well done from what I've seen in a while and it's a fun movie to watch as the characters come well to life in this one. 

The weakness lies in the plot of the movie. It's not bad, but it's not great either. It felt like while a whole lot of effort was put into the visuals of the movie, the overall plot falls flat ‚Äì I don't know if it was trying to be a kid-friendly movie or a blockbuster or societal commentary or all at the same time which makes the movie bland by trying to do all of that. 

It has it's moments but could have used more love when it comes to storytelling. I'm pretty sure the source material from Simon St√•lenberg has more to offer. ",3
"I almost never do reviews, but I guess that this movie did have an upside. 2 hours of me and my friends picking apart and blasting a nonsensicalpike of trash. 320 million dollars and it seems like Chatgpt did the writhing. If we where in a movie theater we would have walked out.",1.5
"I honestly love this movie. The backlash and harsh reviews are completely unnecessary and feel totally unfair. The Electric State is a stunning, emotional, and beautifully crafted film that deserves way more appreciation. The visuals are breathtaking, the performances are top-notch, and the story is deeply moving. I don‚Äôt get why some critics are tearing it apart it‚Äôs an incredible experience from start to finish. Don‚Äôt let the negativity fool you. This movie is absolutely worth watching.

",5
"Of course, the so called professional critics are ripping into what should be a simple escape. Anyone walking into this hoping for The Godfather or 2001 a Space Odyssey is a fool. The film was fun, does it really need to be anything else.",4
"Honestly it felt like a plot that had been done many time.  I was bored 5 minutes into it.  The story line and dialogue was very forgettable. The look of the robots was well done but a part from that, not really sure who the target audience is.  Maybe 10 years olds would enjoy this, but also some heavy themes in it of life and death for young kids",1
"The premise is promising, loosely based on St√•lhages illustrations and with an extraordinary cast, this unfortunately fails to deliver so hard. First of all, going back and forth in time makes the storyline messy and Millie Bobby Brown doesn't really fit the lead. It's unfortunate that the only real connection you get with some om the cast is between Chris Pratt's character and his sidekick robot, voiced by Anthony Mackie. 
",1
"The critics reviews are the exact reason why I always go with the peoples reviews. Those arent real critics. They are hacks. Trust the people that go out to watch a movie to have fun and with families. Not wannabes on Rottoen Tomatoes that nobody even knows how they got critic status in the first place. 
Long story short it was a good movie. Not perfect but well worth the watch. Make your own judgment about the film. You wont be waisting your time. ",4.5
"I have not read the book and cannot attest to it's faithfulness or lack thereof as an adaptation. As a film, though, I think it's terrible. Character design and effects are unsettling and make for a sincerely unpleasant viewing experience. Despite the star-studded cast, I was uninspired by the flat characters and horrifically formulaic writing. It seems the Russo brothers are continuing their tradition of sacrificing all semblance of nuance, depth, or genuinely interesting storytelling for the latest rendition of big action setpieces and painfully misplaced attsmpts at witty one-liners. Every single event in this film can be guessed twenty minutes before it happens. I strongly advise you turn your back on this film and do not look back. Everything about this film is an indictment of modern cinema.",0.5
Critics are trash. Movie was great,5
"Not sure why it's getting ripped apart, is it absolutely amazing..no, but it's not horrible. It's a good watch for what it is. Quit trying to compare it to something else and just enjoy it!",4.5
This was soooo good i loved it.,5
Wayyyyy better than what the critics say.,5
Very average colour by numbers snore-fest.,2
"Positives- 
A prime example of, ""Don't listen to critics and watch the movie yourself"". The movie has a good mix of action and drama, the movie is paced well, the story diverts your expectations.

Negatives-
The setting and moral are generic, the lesson is baseline and not so deep (Great for a family to watch though)",4
"I genuinely enjoyed the movie, loved the vfx loved the story line, I got 2hrs of entertainment with touch of comedy and emotion and that's fine by me. Every movie doesn't need to be oscar winning. So go watch it with your friends family and just have fun. ",4
"This movie was phenomenal in my opinion! It had all the great elements that bring me in as a movie lover. Great relationships, dynamic plot, a sleek of amazing actors! I hope they do a sequel because I would 100% watch! ",5
"I thought it was funny, entertaining and loved the 90's retro throwbacks intertwined in a futuristic/alternate robot world.  The robots were super cute with great 70's-90's themes. The script didn't have a million cuss words in it which was very refreshing.  I really enjoyed it.  
As a Christian, I loved little things intertwined about the Lord.  Evil trying to become God and control the world and the Ultimate Sacrifice given for good to win over evil.  
Then the beautiful ending which accentuated the need for human contact instead of artificial contact.  
Sorry critics, I think you got it wrong. ",4
"This movie is so much better than what the critics would have you believe.  Which goes to show you that critics are talentless snobs with no actual minds to think for themselves.  Critics all seem to think alike and their literally a tiny percentage of the worlds view, so why do we care what they say or think about anything in media? Great CGI and it felt like the characters were on actual sets and not in front of green screens.",5
"Among the fascinating world that the Russo bros give us. There is so much to take in. Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt give a star-studded punch in an alternate universe where robots are misunderstood, and it seems to work. I felt the story telling was superb but a little predictable. Nonetheless worth a watch. ",3.5
"Good watch if you don‚Äôt take to serious. For free on Netflix it was fun.  Great visuals and while predictable story line, it was fun getting there ",4.5
"I saw this movie yesterday evening with my partner before going to bed, and while we agree that this is not masterpiece, it is very good, visually pleasing movie with good acting and made us tear up a little. I think that this time critics pushed too far and showed that maybe we should stray away from their opinions and condescending maneerisms. Overall, I definitely would recommend this is, especially as a friday evening watch.",4
"The Electric State is a science fiction film set to release in 2025, featuring performances from Chris Pratt and Millie Bobby Brown. It premiered on Netflix and has faced overwhelmingly negative reviews from both critics and audiences even before it officially debuted on the platform.

In my opinion, while the movie had its cheesy moments and felt somewhat disjointed, it wasn't as terrible as the reviews suggest. It managed to blend fun and humor, presenting a lighthearted storyline filled with quirky robot antics. Ultimately, it delivered a coherent narrative that maintained a plot throughout, despite a few minor plot holes. I found the design of the brother's robotic counterpart to be particularly imaginative and marketable for merchandise if they choose to pursue that avenue.

As a streaming film, it found the right home on Netflix, which was crucial; had it been released in theaters, it likely would have flopped spectacularly. The storyline may not be as gripping as one would hope, but it offers enough intrigue and creativity to keep viewers engaged. I watched the entire movie and was surprised to realize two hours had passed.

So, I would recommend giving it a chance and forming your own opinion rather than relying solely on others' critiques.",3.5
"Millie Bobby Brown is already too old for teenage roles. She just turned 21‚Äîthe same age Julia Roberts was in Pretty Woman‚Äîso it would be great to see her take on different types of roles and give younger actors the opportunity to play teenage characters.

Beyond that, I found the movie to be highly predictable, with no standout performances and a rather flat storyline. The special effects were impressive, but overall, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it unless you‚Äôre a big fan of MBB.",2
"This was a super fun movie, my family really enjoyed it. We actually put all of our devices down and watch the whole movie from start to finish, five out of five!",5
I have no clue why this has such a bad ranking. If you are a fan of Sci Fi this is a great movie for you. feel like a lot of movie snobs hating on this for no reason. I enjoyed it a lot!,4
It‚Äôs was entertaining. Fun adventure to go on. Not as bad as the critics say. It was directed by the Russo brothers who directed the older marvel movies (the good ones). Worth watching. ,5
"Something bizarre is going on with the critics on this one (17% score at the time of writing this). I'm pretty critical about movies, and I must say, The Electric State was surprisingly fun and thoroughly enjoyable.

It's The Matrix + Ready Player One + Toy Story + Wizard of Oz with 21st century graphics and a 1980s imagination. 

Sure - it's not Citizen Kane... but it's not trying to be! It's a movie you watch in order to spend time with your family, and then 30 minutes into it, you find yourself pleasantly surpised by how entertaining and fun it is. For the critics saying it's just another trite and tired robot movie - I think they're (mostly) wrong. It's definitely not going to win any awards for writing or acting (although the characters are still fun and the acting is still decent); but the movie does approach the dystopian future/robots vs. humans cliche in a relatively original way. 

It's hard to explain why it's rated so poorly by critics... but it's very easy and entertaining to watch by normal people!",4
"This is the perfect fun Netflix Friday night movie. Loaded cast, lots of 90s nostalgia, and the special effects are really impressive. The critical response seems to miss the point, which is that Netflix spent a a ton of money for talented and charismatic people to make an entertaining movie. The plot is certainly ridiculous and there‚Äôs no underlying message, but every movie doesn‚Äôt have to say something deeper about the world. ",4
"I liked a lot. The story got heart and the movie gave me a great time full of emotion and childlike wonder. I don't get why the ""professional"" critics hate it so much to trash it the way they did... maybe they need to find their inner child and realize that sometimes movies are for entertainment pourposes and is okay to like a movie that is not highbrow or what they regard as artsy. I feel sad for the people that wants to be cool and just doesn't know how to really have a simple and fun time, their lives must be sad indeed.",5
"It was a good movie, i think it would've been great to have it like a one season serie, to be able to develop more the characters and that worlds backstory",4.5
"Fun sci-fi fantasy movie. Great cast fun action and Chris Pratt is hilarious. By no means this movie is some Oscars nominee movie, but for a Friday night, kick back enjoy the show kind of movie, I enjoyed it.",5
"Nach all der Kritik im Vorfeld dachte ich, ich schaue mir den Film mal an und versuche, unvoreingenommen zu bleiben. Aber was soll ich sagen? Nichts, was man nicht schon millionenfach gesehen hat. Ein Kampf um Freiheit und Anerkennung mit Chris Pratt, der in Sachen plattem Humor, Clownerie und Sentimentalit√§t direkt von Guardians of the Galaxy kopiert wurde. Ein Antagonist, der so bedrohlich wirkt wie eine Fliege am Fenster. Ein Film, den man nach einer Weile vergisst, weil er nichts besonders Einpr√§gsames bietet. Ich fange an zu glauben, dass Netflix aufgeh√∂rt hat, Inhalte zu produzieren, die zum Nachdenken anregen. Hier findet man keine Tiefe. Er ist flach, austauschbar und leicht zu konsumieren.",1.5
"Fun, feel-good flick. Yes, you knew the good guys were going to win, but the journey was worth it. Totally. So many visual details. Loved Silvestri's supportive score, as well as the pop songs from the 90's. If you're looking for Anora, this will disappoint you. If you're looking for a fun ride, hop on board.",5
Concept was decent and you can tell the budget with massive with high quality graphics and actors but I found some scenes overly drawn out and poorly directed/written. Worth a watch but don't expect anything fantastic,3
"I love all the 1 star reviews from people trying to be professional critics...It's a great, fun movie. Stop being nerds.",4.5
"My wife said 9.8/10 and I say 8.5/10.   This is enjoyable, funny, and has some touching moments.   If a movie can do that, it‚Äôs pretty great.   Not to mention the acting, voice acting and music throwbacks!   Critics be damned.   ",4.5
A fun movie just trying to entertain and not preach like most movies these days.  ,5
"Not a masterpiece, but definitely a fun watch. CGI is pretty good too. Critics are dumb, as always.",3.5
It‚Äôs an amazing piece of fantasy that Hollywood has forgotten to make in the last twenty years.  My seven year old son enjoyed it as much as his 22 year old sister did.  I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and guess the low critical rating is because of Chris Pratt and his political / religious views and nothing else.  Use your own judgment and give this movie the chance it deserves.  ,5
I would say a swing and miss but it didn't even try to swing. ,1
"A truly bad joke of a film when compared with the source material, not to mention stupidly expensive with little to show for it. More garbage Netflix slop for the pile.",1.5
"Great movie, too many haters with no imagination or creativity. Will watch again!",5
"This movie is awful. Such a disappointment with a damn good cast. Great CGI with the robots. But the writing is horrific. And seems like the actors are even giving sup bar acting! Fell asleep the 1st attempt. 2nd attempt, I'm an 1hr40min in and felt the urge to check ratings and review myself. ",0.5
Not sure why it is being panned so badly. This is a good movie. It is thousand times better than the slop rebel moon. Cannot believe critics gave it worse scores then those two disasters. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to my sci Fi living friends. ,4
"A shockingly original and compelling film. What I love most about the film is the way it inspires a childlike sense of awe and wonder. This was accomplished with outstanding production design and a solid script. Who knows how the critics seemingly decide in unison to dictate the fate of a film? It's becoming increasingly important not to let platforms like this dictate the decision of whether a film is worthy of your attention. For the time being, the audiences appear to be the broad public, the audience, tends to be the most reliable barometer. This film will become a CLASSIC!",5
Not the greatest movie but heartfelt and enjoyable to me. It fit the bill for what I was expecting.,3.5
"I really enjoyed this movie.  It was so much fun.  It had emotion, humor, great effects and held my attention till the end.  Love the cast and look forward to more from these directors.",4
"While I thought it could have been better, it was far from horrible. I was entertained and it made my wife cry, so it did it's job. I don't know what the ""professional"" critics were watching.",3.5
"This movie was adorable and funny. So refreshing from the dark and very serious tone of all movies. No politics, underlying messaging, just a fun escape from reality for a couple hours. I wish they made more movies like this.",5
It's entertaining cast is great story is interesting it's a netflix movie it's not going to change your life it's good watch. Critics suck again ,4.5
Even Chris Pratt and Stanley Tucci couldn‚Äôt save this absolutely brain dead dreck. The critics are right for once. ,0.5
This was such a cute movie! I truly enjoyed it. ,5
"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, while it might not go with what was written in the book nothing ever gets translated well to Hollywood when pulled from its original source material but I really really enjoyed this.  I enjoyed the acting and liked the casting of those involved.  The CGI was crisp and didn't feel over the top and I felt the story had an original flare to it.  Do not listen to the Hollywood critics at all and sit down and enjoy this movie.  ",5
"I like Chris Pratt, I like Millie Bobby Brown, I even like Mr. Peanut, but this movie sucks. It's just another ""robots are people too"" pile of garbage.
",1
A playful comedic twist on a dystopian sci-fi.,4.5
I loved it for the Nostalgia but also for the beautiful statement. It lacked the Hollywood message that is so common in movies today. The cast was stellar and why I initially was interested but despite a lot of hate from the critics I found it really refreshing!  There was a bit of silliness that I wanted to dislike but in the end I was even able to overlook Mr. Peanut's potentially foolish appearance because of the writing and direction. ,4
"I‚Äôm really not sure what movie the critics were watching but this was an artfully, emotionally, inspiring movie that provoked thought and engaging conversation . Definitely worth the watch ! ",4.5
"Please ignore the critics, my fiance and I had a great time watching this movie, did not feel overly long, kept us engaged the entire time. We both laughed consistently and was moved by the ending.

The cast was great, Chris Pratt and Millie Bobby Brown were on point, Stanley Tucci was great as always, and the voice acting from the rest of the cast was superb.  

This is a movie we'll watch again. And again.",5
"Many plot holes, poor writing and it dragged a lot. I can't believe it cost $320 million. Then invest more in Pratt's wig at least. What really disturbs me though is that the bad guy is right! He sacrifices the one child to save humanity from destruction by robots. Instead the main characters empower the robots to destroy the only thing keeping them back...it's deeply uncomfortable. If we can't trust robots the first time, let's not try again...everyone seems to have short term memory about this war in the intro to the film and I'm left feeling like the whole movie is inhuman and is even a betrayal of humanity. A movie written to praise robots and AI...Yeah, it's disturbing. I need a drink. ",1
"Empty and forced story with great actors, but a terrible script. Direction was sloppy at best and rushed. Very disappointing. ",0.5
"The movie is fun, fun, fun the characters could use some more development but come on! I don't know why the ""critics"" didn't like it, it's fun! Deal with it ",5
"Let me tell you when I‚Äôm writing this review: I tend to be a biased critic when it comes to Millie Bobby Brown, especially since I think she started dressing like a 40-year-old woman. However, I can honestly say that this movie is wonderful and a lot of fun. I am absolutely convinced that the only reason top critics gave it a poor score is that they felt it wasn‚Äôt diverse enough and have a dislike for Chris Pratt. In today‚Äôs Hollywood, if a movie doesn‚Äôt feature biracial relationships or a diverse cast, critics often label it as terrible. The criticism had nothing to do with the quality or the writing of this fantastic movie.",5
"Why is this getting critically panned. Really good movie, IMO! ",4
"This was an amazing watch for me. An all star cast, great CGI, and an uplifting story of hope, connection, family and perseverance in a wold of hopelessness. Mille Bobby Brown is growing in abilities as an actress. Love your work, Millie! I also appreciated that this movie wasn‚Äôt dark. All shadows and small spaces like so many Sci Fi and Fantasy movies of late. It was bright and expansive. The battles didn‚Äôt dominate with endless action and an ear piercing soundtrack. It was just enough. To me, the story and character development dominated this movie. I‚Äôll definitely watch this again to find the things I missed. What a gem of a movie. ",5
This movie is so much fun and emotional I don't know why they are bashing the movie all over the internet but it is kind of good movie and also if your going to watch without reading the books you will never feel like it is lagging so don't trust the reviews just watch it and decide yourselves,4
Don't listen to the tone deaf snobby unable to read the room critics! This movie has everything you want from an awesome sci fi action flick! It's perfect for family time or date night! The Russo Brothers have done it again! This movie is badass! The acting is top notch and not cringe! The CGI is believable and state of the art! Totally believable! This was a FUN thrill ride with HEART! Don't cheat yourself by not seeing this due to horrible lies from critics! They didn't watch the same movie we just did. We LOVED it! ,5
"Critics missed the boat.  It‚Äôs a fun movie, has a heartwarming ending message of connecting to those around you instead of being tied to your screen.

Great CGI, I actually laughed a couple times, my kids liked it.  It isn‚Äôt meant to be a best picture nominee, I don‚Äôt know what the critics were expecting.",5
The critics are very wrong. I really enjoyed the movie. Millie‚Äôs acting is phenomenal (like always) and Chris is just as good! The visuals 10/10. ,5
This movie was simultaneously fun and thoughtful. We watched with our 13 and 17 year old and both kids and adults enjoyed it. ,4.5
"Critics always wrong, people hating on this movie. Giving it 1 star? This is a really creative movie. Idk why people hating on it. ",4
"La pelicula es bonita, es entretenida, es una aventura con excelentes efectos especiales, los criticos siempre tienen algo malo que decir si afecta a sus patrocinadores como cualquier politico, el cine no carece de este proceso, la pelicula critica la perdida de conexion y la dependencia, el mensaje es claro... si no tomamos nuestras propias decisiones viviremos separados, manipulados, cada vez mas solos, usando las herramientas que aquellos que tienen poder crean para mantenernos sedados y entretenidos mientras toman el control de nuestras vidas y de alguna forma, para evitar que nos demos cuenta que somos iguales nos dividen de muchas formas para hacernos creer que un lado u otro es el problema, esto mientras nos reemplazan y destruyen a todos por el bien de esos pocos que son el verdadero problema.",5
I seriously don‚Äôt understand why people have such an issue with this movie. it‚Äôs cute and funny. i loved it.,3.5
"This movie is beyond words. The animation, the unique designs, the heartfelt story of the characters, and the amazing ending! I enjoyed every second of it! 
10/10 it was worth the years of the wait. 
Sometimes I wonder if the  ""critics"" are ai. I don't see how anyone can say this wasn't spectacular. ",5
"The critics are stupid. This movie was good, It's not a remake, or a reboot and we should all be thankful for that. Someone finally made a high budget movie that wasn't more of the same garbage they keep pumping out.

I swore of theaters in 2019 and I would've been happy to pay to see this in a theater.

I'm not saying it the best movie ever by any means, but it is FAR FAR FAR FAR Better than the ""critics"" are sayin.",5
Lost me in the middle. Could t wait for the point of the story. ,1.5
"Loved Millie Brown in it and the story and world is really entertaining. Really, really great movie. ",5
Critics probably hate this movie because it's wholesome and they have no integrity. A good fun movie for families to enjoy. ,4.5
The story for this movie had such potential I was really letdown with the lighthearted unserious feel of the movie from the beginning.  They really had an opportunity to make a masterpiece but instead made a movie that is more comedic then dramatic ,1.5
I'm not sure what people would expect other than a fun campy movie. It's set in the past which is more futuristic than it was but I love this movie I don't know why the critics hated it so much. I would definitely recommend it. I'll probably watch it again. ,4
"Summary: There is a war between robots (who are basically minimum wage workers) and humans. A big company called Sentre helps win the war. 3 years later this girl (who is in a foster home because her family died in a car accident) finds out that her comatose brother is alive in Sentre, but his mind is in a tiny robot called Cosmo. The story follows her trying to save her brother from Sentre.

Spoilers ahead, if you plan to watch it without spoilers ignore this last bit.

Considering everything that's going on and how many movies have been just trying to make a profit for big corporations, this is a breath of fresh air. At first glance it looks like a stereotypical sci-fi film, random humor, Chris Pratt and a basic plotline, but it isn't. First off, the bots were made to do basic jobs nobody wants to do (minimum wage jobs) and want to be more than working machines, so they fight a war against the humans to get equality. This isn't about robots. This movie could be about many things but considering when this is coming out, I believe it is about one thing. This movie is about so many people being screwed over by big soulless corporations who only care to get money. It is never about human's vs robots because in the end they both are being controlled by Sentre. The robots with their perceived freedom when they are segregated from everyone else and no justice for the people who died just to get the same rights as people. And with humans wasting away on a piece of tech to forget about how their family died for a cause they still think is acceptable. They see each other as enemy's until they find each other's humanity (I get robots aren't technically human just work with me here.) The peanut was going to throw the humans out until he saw how they are people too. Living breathing people with thoughts emotions and feelings. Secondly, Michelle's character is written very well. Her family died, and when they were living, only her brother was there. She mentions how back at home her mom and dad yell at each other and at her. They take their frustrations out on their daughter because they are trying to find a scapegoat for their problems. Her brother is the only person she has left. When he died, she closed herself off to finding another family, running away from foster home after foster home. Until Cosmo came; she saw her brother and she took the only chance she had at getting him back. She was still chasing after a family she lost and closed herself off to others, over the story she learns to trust other people who show that life is worth living and there are good people out in the world. That's why she is able to let her brother go, intern saving the people she has grown fond of. That doesn't diminish that she had to give up her brother, just what she learnt throughout the story helped her be able to change. There is so much more that I could talk about, but I have written 500 words so I should probably stop here. But if you are reading this, don't dismiss movies as cliche without looking deeper first. There is passion here, so please look at it further. :) ",3.5
"I loved this movie so much!!! I watched this with my husband and child and we all 3 loved it. My child is already rewatching this movie lol...Very entertaining, funny, And a great message for kids who are obsessed with sitting on games all day long. Yes pls be apart of the real world kid's...This movie was epic and so worth the wait and worth watching. This is now are fav movie with Milly Bobby Brown who is a Top notch actress shes the best does great movie's and Chris Pratt shines with his big heart, sexy looks, and funny guy humor had us all cracking up.. Yes pls don't listen to these bad reviews , watch this with your kids I promise everybody will love it!!!!",5
Once again the critics are wrong. This was a solid movie with some incredible CGI and scenery. ,4
"This is a great movie, don't listen to the snobby critics that don't seem to understand that not every movie made has to be as deep and thought provoking as Pride and Prejudice, Glory, or The Color Purple. Movies are first and foremost made to ENTERTAIN. Period. Full stop. And this movie was very entertaining and yes it does make you think. Anyone that is paying attention to the real world can see the problem with cellphone addiction and how people walk around like zombies. That was captured very well with the neurocaster device. Ignore the snobs, get some popcorn and watch a good movie. ",5
"I Don‚Äôt know what the critics see, movies is to have fun, is about feelings, laugh, I really like this movie ",5
"I watched this with my family and I must say, it is definitely a movie I wouldn't fall asleep to! The movie has a pretty unique story and reminds me of a certain game set in the fall of America. As a person with an actual soul, I can feel the sadness the main protagonist feels. Also, Chris Pratt makes me laugh. But that's my two cents, and if you already got Netflix, it won't cost you anything to watch this, and you can see for yourself!",4.5
"N√£o achei ruim o entendo do filme e nem os efeitos especiais na verdade gostei muito. 

Esse filme n√£o √© uma grandiosidade dos cinemas mas d√° pra assistir bem relaxado em uma sexta-feira a noite.",4
As it's own thing it was good. May not be like the book and that's prolly hey ppl are hating on it ,5
"Got what I expected, was really entertaining. ",4.5
"best movie ever

criss prat is amazing",5
"Visually keeps pretty true to the book while adding in something new to the story. Do I think there was a better choice than Chris Pratt? Yes, but I can see why he's there. I highly recommend it. It's fine as a standalone movie, but it's even better if you understand the universe the author created. Unless you hate joy and whimsy, then... Idk go eat some plain toast.",5
Well put together. Good story. Overall good watch. Family friendly ,5
Loved it. A great popcorn movie. I wish we could have seen it in the theater.,5
I enjoyed this movie  üôè,5
"Of course a movie the critics hate turns out to be a great movie. Definitely a must watch. Lots of 80s and 90s nostalgia. Good comedy, good action scenes, just a good fun movie. The bot designs remind me of the 1950s tech you‚Äôll find in Fallout game videos. This is a more fun version of that Bruce Willis movie Surrogates or even I Robot",5
i really enjoyed it ,5
"I don‚Äôt know why all the critics are hating on this movie. This movie was really great for the whole family to enjoy. It had a great cast and storyline. The robots had a lot of character too. I really enjoyed this movie, so if you haven‚Äôt seen it, give it a watch and ignore the critics review. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. ",5
I thought the special effects were right on..Story line wasn't bad either. For a Netflix movie i enjoyed every minute of it...i believe you should give it a watch if haven't seen ,4
"Really not sure where the critic hate is coming from.  This movie is not bad. Its not going to win an awards (well maybe for special effects), but it's a solid, enjoyable bit of escapism. ",3.5
This was an enjoyable movie. The feel was 80's Goonies and Howard the Duck for me. ,4.5
very fun movie although not well adapted from the original book from Simon Stalenhag. Billie was a miscast for this role.,3.5
"I almost didnt watch because of the reviews. Great Friday night Si Fi Retro journey.  Best movie ever, no, but fun characters and cool visuals. ",4
Im gonna be honest im not a millie bobbie brown person and i dont think she is the best actor but i loved the movie i thought the message was great the acting was what i expected the cgi was awesome and i will probably watch again if i got nothing else to do ,5
Movie is awesome! Why are critics trying to tank this film? ,4
"Visually stunning. It‚Äôs a fun watch, made me laugh and was ultimately entertaining. Didn‚Äôt pull at my heartstrings although it certainly tried but it was enjoyable. 6 out of 10. ",3
While the visual effects were amazing both the story and the acting were lame. The leads were the same as they have been in everything and the plot was expected and trite. The best part of the movie being on Netflix is that you can fast forward through the lame montage and monologue. The fact that it cost nearly 400 million to make makes me wonder why there are homeless people and people starving in the world. Not awful but just barely. What could have been good was wrecked by someone that was lazy. That is the way the industry is. The glitter can‚Äôt tell the story‚Ä¶and it didn‚Äôt!,1.5
"I'm not sure where all the hate for this movie is coming from. I'm sure it made the red-hats angry somehow.

Anyways, it's a great, fun movie that my whole family enjoyed.  Perfect movie for a Friday night with the family, and or friends.",4
"made an account just to say how dogshit this adaptation was. the source material had so much great sceneries and robot designs, then the russo brothers turned it into a bland netflix slop",0.5
"Critics are crazy, this is a great movie!",5
I have to address the critic reviews first and maybe there's some agenda in which this movie didn't follow the correct politics or something like that because this is not that bad a movie. Is it the greatest No of course not but it's a movie with characters like the toy story and it's enjoyable.,4.5
I can‚Äôt believe how many things are awful in this movie! The writing is ridiculous and embarrassing! The acting from all of the actors is so bad and sophomoric.  All of the robot characters they use are unsympathetic and not likable at all!  This should win big at the Razzies!!,1
This is why nobody likes movie critics or Rotten Tomatoes. The movie is fine and fun... ,4.5
"It wasn‚Äôt Bladerunner or Endgame but It was a fun movie,  not how I would‚Äôve interpreted the book but still a fun movie. ",4
Dystopian robotic version of Toy Story filled with cliche and tropes.  Bailed after 40 mins and I wish I had after 10.,1
Was eh. But what‚Äôs weird is all the accounts leaving 5* that have only reviewed this movie lol. ,3
The critics be trippin'. This is a fun watch!,5
"Bon film √† voir en famille. 
",4.5
"Awesome movie!! It made me laugh, and made me cry! The acting was great. The CGI was great. I don‚Äôt understand why critics have been rating this movie so low!",5
"Not sure what you expert critics were watching but i loved it! Action, drama, and pulling at your heartstrings,  what more could you ask for?",4.5
Electric State was a creative and fun! Enjoyed the unique robots and characters. Some might be slamming it but it was a good watch! ,4
i loved it personally its fun family movie :),5
"As usual, the ""critics"" have no idea what the audience wants to see. Besides the fact that no one picks up the villain's gun, repeatedly... i think this is a very watchable movie with great performances from a star studded cast. ",4.5
"la pelicula cumple con lo que promete, es recomendada para verla en familia",4
"I think it's a very well made film. It doesn't pretend to be an intellectual cult, but a fantasy film to be enjoyed with the family. I find it very well made and fully responsive to expectations. Excellent images and music, in addition to the cgi.",4.5
Really enjoyed this film. Don't get why it's getting such bad reviews ,4
"Millie can‚Äôt act. Bad chemistry with Pratt. Give the robot that ‚Äúcan‚Äôt talk‚Äù a pen to write with and it would solve 99% of the problems they run into. Couldn‚Äôt make it past the first 30 minutes with cringey Millie, a muddy plot and muddier color palette. Sad because Chris Pratt‚Äôs character seems fun but gets bogged down by a poor script and a poor co-lead. Proof that big names and big budgets don‚Äôt equal big payoffs.",1
"Really good movie, that so refreshing to see a movie like this!",5
I have to disagree completely with critics altogether. This movie was pretty darn awesome and had a pretty good message considering the state of the world. If I could give it 6 stars I would.,5
"Not sure where bad reviews are coming from because this is a great watch if you like sci fi movies showcasing by a dystopian world AND a heart-warming adventure. If you're more of a space/suspence/world is ending type of sci fi nerd‚Ä¶ then this movie isn‚Äôt for you.

Family friendly, fun, a little sad, and futuristic but set in the 90s. ",4
Absolutely terrible and a waste of time and money. ,0.5
"Dieser Film ist in meinen Augen Popcorn-Kino f√ºr die ganze Familie. 
Die Story ist leider ziemlich vorhersehbar und ich h√§tte gern etwas mehr Handlung und daf√ºr weniger CGI gesehen. Aber im Grunde besteht der Film aus sehr sch√∂nen Bildern, einer √ºberzeugenden Millie Bobby Brown und einer Message die gut in die aktuelle Zeit passt. 
Ich h√§tte ihn mir auch im Kino angesehen. 
Und auch wenn er weniger √ºberzeugen konnte als z.B. Enola Holmes, werde ich ihn mir bestimmt noch einmal ansehen.",3.5
"St√•lenhags illustrations get their magic from the enigma of the untold. Just as his own novellas sometimes detract from this mystery, this movie does too. So, don't expect anything beyond robots, the '80s, and dystopian landscapes with a splash of cartoonish humor - quite literally.

That said, this movie is definitely worth watching. St√•lenhags unique vision permeates every frame, even when it also feels like it doesn't. Clocking in at over two and a half hours, it might have benefited from a tighter runtime - one and a half hours would have sufficed. Yet, I don't regret the extra hour. It starts off a bit sluggish, and ends in a bit too much of a clich√© melodrama, but perhaps that's because *the loop* in reality never ends.

St√•lenhag's work continues to surprise, remaining dynamic and thought-provoking. A movie, by nature, is not; its fixed narrative cannot rival the fluidity of imagination. So, leave your static expectations behind and let the film take you on its altered journey.",4
"All this Movie needed was One Hooker-Bot who was a Robot-Revolutionary,other than that it was great.",3.5
"La pel√≠cula es muy emotiva con escenas de acci√≥n muy buenas, los escenarios y de la calidad ni hablar se ve hermoso el dise√±o de los personajes, la historia la siento un tanto clich√© pero busca su propio camino hay algunos personajes desperdiciados como el doctor o el villano principal su redenci√≥n la sinti√≥ un tanta apresurada y sin motivos v√°lidos pero la pel√≠cula busca su propio encanto en la producci√≥n y los personajes le doy cuatro estrellas porque las escenas de acci√≥n no se tienen tanto cortas debieron al durar un poquito m√°s de acci√≥n est√° bien la pel√≠cula pero creo que s√≠ le falt√≥ ese detalle que se le hubiera dado m√°s hubiera sido m√°s entretenida recomendada.",4
"A lot of spectacle to fool you into thinking they are saying something important,  but it's completely empty at its core.   And the stars are just weird together.   But it looks nice visually. ",0.5
"Not groundbreaking, yes it's another robot movie but I really enjoyed this friday night family movie. It's that and only that. Expecting anything else?  give it a swerve.  ",5
"Crikey, after 10 minutes I was actually thinking this is pretty good. Then everything I feared was going to happen actually happened coupled with the most unrewarding ending you‚Äôll ever see in your life. Both Pratt and Brown felt extremely wooden and never reached any sort of chemistry. A true disappointment.",0.5
Really liked this film and the robots reminded me of IOI from ready player one,5
Extrem langweilig und einfallslos,1
Critics might hate it but it was fun. Oscar worthy? No. Worth a Friday night? Absolutely. ,4.5
"Great movie 
Room for sequel. 
Exciting , great graphics ",5
"Don't listen to the ""critics"" those guys are there to ruin days and try and convince you everything sucks, while the electric state is the opposite! I could quite honestly watch an 8 part series of that film, there is soooooo much more story to tell about that world! Very good subliminal messaging about the disconnected modern world 10/10 from me",5
"With how horrendous all the early reviews were for this film and reports that the film's budget was north of $300 million, I knew I had to check it out for myself. Somehow, with my expectations as low as possible, it still ended up disappointing me. The Electric State is based on the book of the same name by Simon St√•lenhag, but adapted by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. While I can‚Äôt speak to the quality of the book, given I haven‚Äôt read it, this might be one of the worst-written films I‚Äôve ever seen. With so much controversy recently surrounding the use of AI in filmmaking, I mean this with the utmost seriousness: everything in this feels like a ChatGPT-generated response. The screenplay is full of clunky exposition and horribly written dialogue where none of the emotional beats or jokes land, all while being the most generic and contrived product that feels devoid of human touch, which is all the more ironic for a film whose message is to get out in the real world and not rely too heavily on technology.",0.5
I think it could have been much better but isn't the worst and they could save it still when they make a second movie based on the book.,2.5
"Fun romp not to be taken so seriously, critics dont know what they are talking about. ",4
"Really don't understand the hate. Why do we need movies like this to be deep and meaningful ""oh there's no message"". It feels like a throw back to a time when summer blockbusters weren't superhero movies. It looked great, sound track was decent. It's a really fun popcorn flick. Give it a try, it's a switch your brain off movie, just enjoy two hours of something that doesn't take its self to seriously. Another review bomb sufferer.
",4
"It had character development, family values, made me care for the story and the characters, cool graphics, robots and the actors were good at their roles. I liked it",5
I loved it. Not sure what the critics deal is. It‚Äôs as if they refuse to give praise to a movie based solely on enjoyment factor. I really hope there‚Äôs a sequel!,5
"silly and boring, no fun, no excitement, wasted time, really bad cinema even for Netflix",0.5
"Mir hat der Film gefallen, alles mal ein bisschen altes als neues dargestellt, wunderbar.....",5
"This movie is everything it is promised to be! An absolute must watch, you will not be disappointed! ",5
"This is a great movie, the first one our five year old was glued to jumping around shouting at it. We all loved it! ",5
"Movie is ok. Acting feels flat, but the robots are good. Don't expect the best story. Just watch when you don't have anything else to watch. ",3
"If this movie cost over $320 million dollars to make, I hope at least $295 million of it went strictly to Stanley Tucci.",2.5
Great movie. It‚Äôs fun and different. Anyone not paying attention to the very clear message that people are addicted to their devices has probably stopped reading this already.  Millie looks great. Not every movie needs to be heavy dialogue.  Also this is a kids movie not an adult movie so calm down on the bad reviews. Would you kid like the movie? Probably. ,5
"At the start, I felt there was a pretty long info dump‚Äîthe movie could have started at a later point. But aside from that, I really loved it. I loved how it connected to the addiction to technology today, how the actors brought the characters to life, and how it had a great mix of humor, emotional moments, and action. What I loved most was the ending‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt expect it at all, and it made the movie even better. The CGI was amazing! The script and the storystructure sometimes felt a bit off, but the actors did such an amazing job that they made up for that. If it had started about 10 minutes later, it would have been a 5-star movie for me.",4
"Visually it's stunning, is it the best CGI? No, there are some green screen fuzziness in areas but overall a retro futuristic 90s visual good looker.
As for the story it has a few predictable twist and turns but enjoyable with some good musical choices to help tie in the nostalgic feeling of this alternate past. Chris Pratt plays Chris Pratt as always but he's entertaining and that's why most like him, Millie Bobby(perhaps Bonnie) Brown gives a fair performance too.
Gotta love the characterisation of some of these bots too.

"It's a classic turn off your brain, laptop open, movie in the background that but you happen to pay a little more attention to the movie then elsewhere. The CGI is actually pretty incredible (which I hope so it being $320mm).


One major knock: Millie....she doesn't fit this. I actually think this movie could creep towards 80-85% if different actress.",3
"$300 million down the drain. What a terrible film. It felt like the actors realized they had ended up in a truly bad movie and had no idea how to handle their discomfort with the flimsy storyline and the paper-thin depth of their characters.

At no point was the film engaging or genuinely funny. Instead, it leaned towards childish humor that failed to land. The robots, which should have been a highlight, were uninspired and lacked any real emotional connection.

A visually expensive but emotionally hollow experience.

"Good movie, not perfect. Critics should lighten up.. Starts incredibly strong, mighta done some stuff diff in the middle & idk how I feel about an ending narrative choice but the final shot made it OK lol.... Coulda been better I guess but coulda been so much worse & overall was just an entertaining solid popcorn family movie I have no idea how or why critics are so cynical.  ",4.5
"Vale la pena verla, 10/10",5
Not sure the critics saw the same movie as me. Such a fun nostalgia trip with some of the absolute best production/tech design I've ever seen in a movie. If you can't have fun with a movie like this you probably can't have fun anywhere...,5

The electric state is amazing movie ,5
"It is inspired by the book. Not meant to BE the book and that‚Äôs okay. I like having them be separate entities. That said, it‚Äôs thoroughly enjoyable and the visuals are fantastic. A solid B+ movie. Saw from my home. Enjoyed it. Nothing life changing. I recommend. ",4
"I don‚Äôt know what to tell you, I liked it a lot üòÄ
The script is the main issue. Everything else works. The CGI is REALLY good, and so is the cinematography. Chris Pratt plays Peter Quill, and Millie Bobby Brown plays Millie Bobby Brown‚Äînothing new.
The soundtrack is by Alan Silvestri, and I feel like he borrowed a bit from Infinity War and Endgame, but I‚Äôm not complaining.

No se que decirles, a mi me gust√≥ bastante üòÄ‚Ä®El guion es el principal problema. Todo el resto funciona. El CGI est√° MUY bien y la cinematograf√≠a tambi√©n.

"I think the critics are taking this film too seriously. Or they‚Äôre trying to tie it in to present real life circumstances. I don't think this movie is trying to be something it‚Äôs not. It was a good story and the effects were pretty flawless. Do I give a crap on how much money they spent to make it? No. That‚Äôs not my concern. If Netflix, or anyone else, wants to spend a crazy amount of money on a movie and hopes it pays off, that‚Äôs their business.  That shouldn‚Äôt factor in to the review of this movie. And don‚Äôt get me started on reviews comparing it to the book. I‚Äôm just going to say this one time: a majority of the people that will see this movie have not read the book. That pretty much sums up ALL movies or shows that are based off books or games. So quit with the pretentious nonsense, get off your imaginary high horse and just enjoy a movie for what it is. ",4

- Action
- Some of the best CGI I've seen
- Humor

Watch it, you will not be disappointed.

"The cgi, the characters are good, the story is very good, but I sometimes think that the movie is in the 2000s era when it's actually taking place in the 1990s era, and in my opinion it's not a bad movie.",4.5
the electric state had a source of story from the novel which was a well executed story about the post apocalyptic world after a robot uprising with a darker reality of warfare shown through fantasy however the movie deviated from the novel showcasing a lighter tone to these themes and excludes many important factors that made the novel so immersive. the tone of the movie doesn't retain the factor that the world is at a darker note after the robot war. the VFX was one of the most defining parts of the whole movie and the human characters felt a little AI with weird dialogues and catchy lines that felt computer generated. the movie is similar to other post apocalyptic movies and had no sense of originality to it. this movie defined the fact that even with A-list celebs a movie with bad direction and writing can't be saved. ,0.5

"They tried to turn a small moody graphic novel into a giant tentpole family friendly blockbuster and it fails at everything.  An example of the worst aspects of board room driven movie making.  It seems like one of those movies where everyone from corporate and marketing got their say....""Hey how about a gratuitous guest appearance from ________?  This will really boost our metrics in this quadrant!""  ""OMG...we just signed a deal with OASIS!...This movie is going to be FANTASTIC!""

In the end, they seemed to focus so much of their energy on designing the product that they forgot they were making a movie. 

This was the final straw for me...done with Netflix. ",0.5
This is a good family movie and great escapism.   I found the critics to be harsh on the film.  I wasn‚Äôt expecting ‚ÄúSchindler‚Äôs List‚Äù or ‚ÄúGone with the Wind‚Äù given the source material for the film was a graphic novel.  It was just fun to watch.,4

I just kept finding myself asking why? 300+ million being spent on this pointless, wanna be Ready Player One is such a shame considering the projects that could‚Äôve been funded with that money. The CG is pretty amazing though, I will give them that.
Also a hilariously ironic message ‚ÄúGo get out and be with other humans, make connections, live life‚Äù, as they create this film to watch on a streaming service from the comfort of your own home.",1.5
"The Electric State is an Adventure Sci-fi Film featuring Chris Pratt As Keats, Millie Bobby Brown as Michelle, Woody Harrelson as Mr. Peanut, and Ke Huy Quan as Dr. Amherst. A summary of the plot would be that Michelle Who's Been Hoping foster home after foster home one day comes across a robot who turns out to be her long-deceased brother, said robot wants to travel to Table Rock to find Dr. Amherst who gave him this robot body. They then come across Keats and his Robot Friend They are then chased by the butcher and end up being trapped in the electric state and captured by Mr. Peanut, after they attempt to find Dr. Amherst, He then dies only leaving his robot companion and the location of Christopher's body. They go to said location and end Sentre by killing Christopher.

The Overall Meaning of the Original Graphic Novel Is completely thrown out the window replacing the meaning and most of the atmosphere with a generic Sci-fi Movie, but after all, you can't have an Atmospheric Movie in Big Budget Hollywood anymore so this is the best they could pull out of their Soulless industry. However, after all of that, the budget of this movie and SFX and CGI Did most of the heavy lifting Offering Dynamic Fight scenes that Make this movie watchable. So given that there's almost nothing else going for this movie, the overlying story of the Graphic Novel is completely thrown out of the window replacing it with a Non-sensical plot that only gets good when the Previously Mentioned CGI and SFX are in play. The Aforementioned Atmosphere of the Graphic Novel by the same name is same as the overall story completely thrown out of the window only displaying some of the key features such as the Machines and some of the landscapes Shown in the book. The acting and Directorial direction for this movie is as good as big-budget Hollywood can get only using the Russo Brothers, which only know how to direct big fight scenes and actors who only know how to act as themselves, which as almost Everything else completely sucks the living energy out of the undoubtedly Atmospheric and Emotional presence of the book. One little Positive that gives this movie its Extremely Generous Ranking is the Incorporation of the lore, which to my Knowledge isn't too far off from the books but like everything else in this movie could use so much more energy. So should you watch the Russo's Brothers Most Recent Blockbuster, a short answer is No, It's a Lifeless Corpse of the once Energetic and Marveling book that has undergone Extreme Dumb downing of the story, meaning, and Horrible, Horrible Acting and Directing by the Stars and the Directors.",1
"This movie is so good, moving and has a very beautiful moral. Our family is the most precious thing we can have. The acting of Millie and Chris like all the others was incredible. ",5
"The Electric State is a vibrant mashup of atompunk and retrowave, delivering amazing visuals and a refreshing blend of drama and fun. Millie Bonnie Brown Bongiovi shines in her role, while Chris Pratt's captivating performance anchors the film.

Despite some critics overreacting to some quirky choices‚Äîlike the peanut leading the robots‚Äîthe movie‚Äôs playful absurdity is exactly its charm. A well-rounded, entertaining experience that shouldn't be taken too seriously.",4.5
"Talking about our future if we fight like AI and talking about a good message people need to stick together people not always need to fight people need to move on with life.
Very funny, sad too. I recommend to see this movie again.",5
It's pretty cool film to be honest. I like the concept of the sentient robots (done many times before of course). I did feel the characters were well played. Its obviously not the huge blockbuster it may have wanted to be but the details are good. The CGI robots and set designs are pretty good. It's good to put your feet up and go on an adventure with a bit of heart üíú.,3
"Shocking, the critics got it wrong again. 
I get it, there‚Äôs nothing uniquely different about this film from other post apocalyptic robot tales, however, The Electric State has family movie night appeal. The kids will bust out laughing, I know I did, several times. Oh and the soundtrack is a thing of greatness. 

That said, Chris Pratt is basically playing Starlord again and well, I‚Äôm here for it. Anthony Mackie shines as the voice of Herb. Millie Bobby Brown is terrific as usual. Sincerely, the cast is stacked, and I can tell every last one of them had a blast at work. 

Two thumbs up. ",4

"**Review: The Electric State** ‚Äì ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω  

Okay, so *The Electric State* should‚Äôve been a slam dunk. Chris Pratt? Love him. The rest of the cast? Absolutely stacked. The Russo Brothers? They've never let me down before. And you can *see* the money Netflix threw at this ‚Äî from the first shot, it‚Äôs clear this is their most expensive film ever. But honestly‚Ä¶ maybe they shouldn‚Äôt have spent that much. For that kind of budget, I expect nothing short of greatness, and this ain‚Äôt it.  

Visually, yeah, it‚Äôs stunning ‚Äî the effects, the world-building, the robot designs ‚Äî all top-notch. But man, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve seen this movie before. The first act sets things up nicely, but the second act? Snooze fest. It drags so hard it could‚Äôve easily been trimmed by 30 minutes. And the third act? Just cold and soulless. The story itself is actually solid, but it‚Äôs missing heart. A dystopian sci-fi adventure with robots fighting should have me on the edge of my seat ‚Äî instead, I felt nothing. It‚Äôs impressive to look at, but emotionally? Flatline.  

This could've been incredible ‚Äî the ingredients were there ‚Äî but somehow it just ends up feeling hollow.",2.5
I thought it was a fairly fun Popcorn movie. ,4
"Great acting, great motion capture and great directing. The story is one of the best I've seen so far in the last few years and it hits home.

I really liked how the characters interacted with robots and how the robots had there own personalities and added so much to the movie also really loved Millie Bobby Browns character Michelle and the heart and determination she brings to her character as well as Chris Pratts, Stanley Tucci as the villain,and the boy who played the little brother. Everyone truly shined in this movie to me so I personally give it a 10.",5

"This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I sort of take that back - it LOOKS spectacular - but it's boring, sluggish, poorly acted, deeply unfunny, deeply manipulative (I wish it could have actually squeezed some emotion out of me) and the writing is just... bad. I wish the visuals alone were enough to sustain it. They had moments of swelling music and semi-regular emotional beats - and they just did NOT land. It came across as awkward and honestly it looked like all the actors gave up. The wigs were distracting, Chris Pratt phoned it in (he's terrible in this), MBB tries a bit in the earlier scenes, but the efforts are apparently abandoned midway through. I did finish it, hoping that something would happen. It doesn't. 1/10.",0.5
"The CGI and camera work was amazing.. the story lacked a little.. Chris Prat was.. amazing.. his typical role, nothing fancy.. it works, but Billy Brown.. maan she proved again she can't act..

I honestly don't understand what the issue is with this movie. The actors/actresses in this movie are amazing. The acting overall is great. I love the storyline of the film.

Overall, I loved this movie. I will definitely watch the film again in the future!",5
"Brown & Pratt work together well to bring this story of a fantasticsl world to life! Quan is great as the mislead scientist and Norman is great as young Greene the heart & soul behind all of this mad rootless. The bots are fantastic, each does their part to move the story along. Tucci is so subtly antsy it‚Äôs pitiful. It‚Äôs too complicated to explain all the ins & outs of this story, but even with the darkest parts exposed it‚Äôs still something to behold, almost a future classic!",4

"40 minutes in and still can‚Äôt get past the absolutely horrible writing and pace of this film. This could have been a great film, but lazy writing and poor directing ruined it. It‚Äôs hard to care about a film when the plot is thin and the characters are never developed. Who produces scripts like this? Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt don‚Äôt save this film. DOGE should have defunded this film.",1.5
"Far better than you might expect for a Netflix movie, with likeable characters and a few good laughs in the script. Despite a fairly stellar line up amongst the human cast it‚Äôs really the robots that steal the show, there‚Äôs also some nice messages about connecting with people in the real world and reaching across the divides in society. A good family watch although some scenes might be a bit scary for the very young.",4
"The visuals in this film are pretty cool but, the acting, storyline, and pacing is mediocre at best. Millie Bobby Brown proves again she cant act, the only actor worth anything is Chris Pratt. He is his usual character here. If you want a movie to kill time this is ok, but you will never get it back.",0.5
