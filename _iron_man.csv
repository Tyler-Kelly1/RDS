Iron Man needs no explanation! Go watch it for your self if you don't believe me.,5
4 words â€”> I am Iron Man.,4.5
He is Iron Man homie,5
"Classic, it's pretty much the first Avengers movie. Stark is annoyingly narcissistic and I genuinely do not know how Pepper wrangled with him all these years.

I particularly enjoyed the build up of Stark in the middle east, and how he realizes his weapons are just that: weapons of war and mass destruction.",4
"Really good movie, good mcu movie, 10/10 highly recommend",5
"A brilliant start to a brilliant MCU! Robert Downey Jr. completely revived his career with tact, wittiness and humor.",5
Now this is peak cinema. Iron man is a perfect example of how to do a movie right. The pacing is great the characters are even better and don't even get me started on the character development. amazing.,5
"The movie that started it all. Entertaining from start to finish, this movie created the blueprint for the right tone in the MCU. Fun, mostly light and funny, but able to have real weight and consequences and incredible action. Robert Downy junior was spot on. The movies only flaw was a great villain in Jeff Bridges that gets under-utilized and ultimately meets a flat end. A must watch for comic fans and anyone who loves action movies.",4.5
"Iron Man is not just a great superhero movie. It is the foundation of an entire cinematic movement. Even after all these years, it still holds up.

Robert Downey Jr.â€™s performance remains one of the best in the genre. He perfectly balances arrogance, charm, and vulnerability. The filmâ€™s themes of war profiteering and corporate responsibility feel just as relevant today. The action is still thrilling, especially in the first two acts. The only real weakness is Obadiah Stane, who works well enough but does not leave a lasting impression.

What makes Iron Man endure is its focus. It is a personal, character-driven story that does not feel like an extended trailer for sequels. It proves that the best superhero films start with compelling characters, not just spectacle. Looking back, this might be the last time Marvel made a film without knowing if the next one would exist. That uncertainty gave Iron Man a sense of weight that is missing from many of its successors.",4.5
"Iron Man: 9.5/10

An excellent film which is a perfect start to the MCU you get a good idea for the character Tony Stark and how smart charismatic and witty he is while also being a playboy. It really is the perfect actor for the role, the movie also has a great story and the villain is excellent, he has a clear motive he wants to use the suit for war and profit while Tony wants to use the suit to save the world and help people. It has a great story which shows how Tony changed his perspective in regards to making weapons, it also shows how intelligent he is and how the origins of creating the suit came to be, it also showed how his whole perspective went from creating weapons to wanting to create a difference.",4.5
The first MCU movie is still one of the best.,4.5
Iron Man is a truly legendary revolution in Marvel history.,4.5
"ONE of best superhero movies of all time, they got the character of Iron man, they knew what the people wanted and delivered",5
"RDJ's entertaining lead performance, fantastic dialogue, and memorable moments make this a really strong start to the MCU - even if the third act falls a bit short.",4
"PEAK Movie, The first Iron Man movie is the GOAT. ðŸ¤¯ðŸ”¥ And The beginning of a (used to be) Legacy",5
Amazing Start To An Amazing Universe That Saved RDJs Career Great Movie,5
"Iron Man is a very enjoyable and satisfying movie with a hell of a cast.

The dialogues are my favourite part of the writing. I loved when a character said something and we saw the opposite of that on screen. The characters are enjoyable, but after a while the movie doesn't just use Tony Stark as its protagonist, but tries make audience forget that he is not a good person. The story is quite satisfying, the antagonist is a flat character, but he is also hateable.

The directing is quite good, I noticed Jon Favreau used the same lighting in the cave scenes similarly in The Mandalorian. The cinematography is also pretty good, nothing too fancy, just engaging. The editing is simple, but the pacing is really good. The acting is great, while the casting is perfect. Although I'm curious what Tom Cruise would've done with the character.

Iron Man is funny, satisfying and perfectly-cast. It's a great start to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",4
"Robert downey jr Ã© um ator da porraaaaa, sempre que o tony stark ta na cena da vontade de ver mais e mais e mais",4.5
"The perfect beginning to the MCU, and the perfect hero we needed to kick it off. Robert Downey Jr. becomes the first MCU superhero as he steps into the role of a rich, head-of-weapons-manufacturing, playboy Tony Stark. As he tries secure the legacy of Stark Industries by taking it into a new direction with new enemies loathing this decision. With Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Jon Favreau, and Gwyneth Paltrow, this cast is star-studded already going into a new fame for each name. Iron Man secures his legacy here in both the future of the MCU movies and his own self.",5
"The start of a great legacy, this film is iconic and memorable. The characters remain memorable and effective, with humor and seriousness mixed together very well. The cgi is great most of the time, but some of it is hidden in shadows, making it difficult to see some key moments. Apart from that, this is a fantastic superhero movie.",4.5
"Amazing actor, nice story. Just an awesome film.",4.5
A great start of the MCU Robert Downey JR is a great casting for Tony Stark.,4
"What a great start!! 
A fitting movie to start the MCU!! 
Iron Man's origin is depicted beautifully, it's a really good movie!! 
I was very surprised by Obadiah's betrayal and the appearance of Nick Feely!! 
It's a really fun movie!!",5
Loved it  I miss this kind of Marvel movies,5
Usually love war movies and super heros but this movies is so empty the only feeling i got from it was the need to sleep. One of the worst cheasy amircan war propaghanda movies i have seen so far...,1.5
Amazing movie robert fits soo good,5
"The demonization of Muslims is not okay, even for 2008. It sets back the film a lot, though it's otherwise enjoyable.",1.5
Still the best live action Marvel movie.,5
"Iron Man is different from other superhero movies.
The first 30 minutes are amazing because it's different from what most people expect.
Tony Stark is well developed, showing that unlike other heroes, he is a powerful billionaire.
The story is interesting, the villain has his strengths and weaknesses but he's still good.
Furthermore, the film has moments of humor at the right time.
It's worth spending 2 hours watching this Marvel masterpiece.",5
I love Iron Man 3000!,5
I liked when he said MAXIMUM PULSE,5
Robert Downey Jr. cements himself as the face of the MCU with a grounded and rich storyline that sees Tony Stark change into Iron Man. They donâ€™t makes superhero films like this anymore.,5
It's a very enjoyable film it's worth a watch story wise not that great,3.5
One of the best films in the MCU .,5
Peak cinema. This is how you make a grounded superhero movie. Watching Tony Stark change through the film really makes you happy for him when he succeeds. Watching him rise to the top after being at the bottom is quite rewarding for the audience. RDJ's acting is also stellar and he truly embodies the essence of Tony Stark. The practical effects are costume design is also really good!,5
